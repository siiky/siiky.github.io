This site is also on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) now!

You can (probably not) find it on a public gateway, but here it is anyway:
https://$cid$.ipfs.dweb.link

You should get better results if you run your own [IPFS
node](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) and have the [IPFS
companion](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion) installed.
