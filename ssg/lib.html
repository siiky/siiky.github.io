<h1># SSG, <em>_the Library_</em>
</h1>SSG was originally written as a CLI program. You would call it with the
description of your site through arguments and external files. The arguments
would tell it where to look for source files, and the index would tell it which
source files to include in the site index. This is very simple, and works
pretty well; I can't complain! But maybe only because I made it this way, to
fit this particular site. If I wanted to change the site structure
significantly, it would require changing SSG's internals, probably CLI
arguments, CLI arguments parsing, ... There's probably a better way!

I'll try to change how SSG works, allowing more flexibility, maybe even better
performance, while not forcing anything on anyone! From now on, you don't
generate your site by describing it through CLI arguments and external files.
Your site is not generated by <em>_some_</em> site generator; your site is generated by
<em>_your_</em> site generator!

Can it be done?
