* Useful Queries

This is a list of useful queries I've learned over time.

** Features last modified by an user

#+BEGIN_SRC txt
nwr(user:"user name")({{bbox}});
out body;
#+END_SRC

** Features modified between two dates

Node, way, or relation amenities modified between 2022-02-04T00:00:00Z and
"to-date":

#+BEGIN_SRC txt
// The to-date is optional and defaults to now
[diff:"2022-02-04T00:00:00Z","to-date"];
nwr["amenity"]({{bbox}});
out body;
#+END_SRC
