Found this library reading [[https://weeklyosm.eu/archives/14825][WeeklyOSM 580]] called "prettymaps":
https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps

It does indeed create pretty maps!

Found also a website that exposes a limited set of options to the library:
https://prettymaps-online-nzcbpymxfq-uc.a.run.app

And created this pretty thing from https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/40.4144/-7.7073:
