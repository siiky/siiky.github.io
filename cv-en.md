# Education

Studied Computer Science at the University of Minho for my Bachelor's, and
currently enrolled for my Master's in Informatics Engineering, also at the
University of Minho, specializing in _Formal Methods_ and _Distributed Systems_.

# Professional Experience

## Internship at Accenture (July 2019)

The assigned job was developing unfinished, as well as new, features for a
consumer facing product. These entailed working with _Augmented Reality_ in iOS.
In the process, I've also learned about the Scrum development framework.

## _Application Security Analyst_ at Checkmarx (September 2019 ~ September 2021)

The job as an analyst consists in analysing existing security vulnerabilities,
with or without a CVE number, the end goal being to learn which versions of the
affected software are vulnerable in reality. Although I'm not tasked with
software development, apart from the occasional improvement to our internal
tools of everyday use, as vulnerabilities are found in a wide range of projects,
I come in contact with many languages, with the most common being C, Clojure,
Java, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

## _Software Engineer_ at Lamassu (September 2021 ~ present)

Responsible for maintaining and refactoring existing code and developing new
features, using almost exclusively JavaScript on Node.js and React projects.
Getting to learn a lot about blockchain research and especially cryptocurrency,
but also the mess that is JavaScript... Work involves usual web development,
both back and front-end, but also development of internal-use libraries to
interface with cryptocurrency nodes and servers. Biggest feature yet was
replacing an old _ad-hoc_ `REST`-like machine-server interface with a very
strict GraphQL one.

# Additional Information

## Areas of Interest

I'm a big proponent of the FLOSS movement and sharing of knowledge in general.
On my spare time I work on/contribute to open source projects, personal and
otherwise, I frequently contribute to [OpenStreetMap] mainly as a mapper, and
occasionally contribute to Wikipedia.

I have a special interest in functional and distributed programming, and in
code quality. I believe low-level details and performance to be very important
aspects of programming and programming languages, and because of this, the
languages that have caught my eyes most recently are [Elixir], [CHICKEN]
[Scheme], and [Rust].

Other than technical programming-related topics, I enjoy reading and learning
about various other hard and natural sciences. These include, but are not
limitted to: mathematics (especially abstract math), philosophy, psychology,
ecology, zoology, botany, physics, and chemistry.

Additionally, I write from time to time about these subjects on my personal
website, to better organize myself and my thought, and in hope that my writings
may be of use to other sentient beings as limitted as myself.

## Open Source Work

Of the open source projects I work on and contribute to, such as [IPFS] and the
[CHICKEN] [Scheme] ecosystem, these may be my most notable contributions:

<https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/ipfs.scm> & <https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/ipfs.lua>
 ~ Author & maintainer of [IPFS] HTTP RPC clients in [CHICKEN] [Scheme] and Lua.

<https://www.phpmyadmin.net>
 ~ Found and responsibly disclosed [CVE-2020-26935], while working at Checkmarx.

<https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags>
 ~ Found and fixed two `NULL`-dereference bugs.

<https://github.com/siiky/invidious.scm>
 ~ Author & maintainer of an Invidious REST API client in [CHICKEN] [Scheme].

<https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/transmission.scm>
 ~ Author & maintainer of a Transmission RPC client in [CHICKEN] [Scheme].

<https://github.com/iraikov/chicken-unitconv>
 ~ Changed all floating-point constants to exact numbers, in order to improve
   arithmetic precision by default.

## Programming Languages

From University and personal projects, the languages that I have experience
with, enjoyed working with, and would like to work with again:

 * [Erlang]
 * [Scheme]
 * C
 * [Haskell]

From reading books, papers and blogs, the languages that I would like to learn:

 * [Elixir] -- the "next-gen" [Erlang], with lots of new features, and good
   tooling;
 * [Rust] -- safe systems language, with an advanced type system;
 * [Idris] -- for playing with types;
 * [Go] -- for simple concurrency management;
 * [Common Lisp] -- for advanced metaprogramming and arbritary compile-time
   computation.

## Events

I have participated in programming contests, such as [Google Hash Code],
[Google Code Jam], [Google Kickstart], MIUP and Battle of Universities; and
have attended tech-related conferences, such as [LambdaDays].
