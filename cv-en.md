# Education

Studied Computer Science at the University of Minho for my Bachelor's, and
currently enrolled for my Master's in Informatics Engineering, also at the
University of Minho, specializing in _Formal Methods_ and _Distributed Systems_.

# Professional Experience

## Internship at Accenture (July 2019)

The assigned job was developing unfinished, as well as new, features for a
consumer facing product. These entailed working with _Augmented Reality_ in iOS.
In the process, I've also learned about the Scrum development framework.

## Application Security Analyst at Checkmarx (September 2019 ~ September 2021)

The job as an analyst consists in analysing existing security vulnerabilities,
with or without a CVE number, the end goal being to learn which versions of the
affected software are vulnerable in reality. Although I'm not tasked with
software development, apart from the occasional improvement to our internal
tools of everyday use, as vulnerabilities are found in a wide range of projects,
I come in contact with many languages, with the most common being C, Clojure,
Java, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

## Software Engineer at Lamassu (September 2021 ~ present)

Responsible for maintaining and refactoring existing code and developing new
features, using almost exclusively JavaScript on Node.js and React projects.
Getting to learn a lot about blockchain research and especially cryptocurrency,
but also the mess that is JavaScript... Work involves usual web development,
both back- and front-end, but also development of internal-use libraries to
interface with cryptocurrency nodes and servers. Biggest feature yet was
replacing an old, and pretty _ad-hoc_, `REST`-like machine-server interface with
a very strict GraphQL one.

# Additional Information

## Open Source Work

On my spare time I work on personal projects and contribute to open source
projects, such as IPFS and the CHICKEN Scheme ecosystem. The most notable among
them:

<https://github.com/siiky/ipfs.scm> & <https://github.com/siiky/ipfs.lua>
 ~ Author & maintainer of IPFS HTTP RPC clients in CHICKEN Scheme and Lua.

<https://github.com/siiky/invidious.scm>
 ~ Author & maintainer of an Invidious REST API client in CHICKEN Scheme.

<https://github.com/siiky/transmission.scm>
 ~ Author & maintainer of a Transmission RPC client in CHICKEN Scheme.

<https://www.phpmyadmin.net>
 ~ Found and responsibly disclosed CVE-2020-26935, while working at Checkmarx.

<https://github.com/siiky/c-utils>
 ~ Type-generic data structures and utilities written in C, tested with
   QuickCheck-like tests.

<https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags>
 ~ Found and fixed two `NULL`-dereference bugs.

<https://github.com/iraikov/chicken-unitconv>
 ~ Changed all constants to exact numbers, to improve precision.

## Areas of Interest

I'm a big proponent of the FLOSS movement and sharing of knowledge in general.

I have a special interest in functional and distributed programming, and in code
quality. I believe low-level and performance to be very important aspects of
programming and programming languages, and because of this, the languages that
have caught my eyes most recently are Elixir, CHICKEN Scheme, and Rust.

Other than technical programming-related topics, I enjoy reading and learning
about various other random hard and natural sciences. These include, but are not
limitted to: mathematics (especially abstract math), philosophy, psychology,
ecology, zoology, botany, physics, and chemistry.

Additionally, I write from time to time about these subjects, to better organize
myself and my thought, and in hope that my writings may be of use to other
sentient beings as limitted as myself.

## Programming Languages

From University and personal projects, the languages that I have experience
with, enjoyed working with, and would like to work with again:

 * Erlang
 * Scheme
 * C
 * Haskell

From reading books, papers and blogs, the languages that I would like to learn:

 * Elixir -- the "next-gen" Erlang, with lots of new features, and good
   tooling;
 * Rust -- safe systems language, with an advanced type system;
 * Idris -- for playing with types;
 * Go -- for simple concurrency management;
 * Common Lisp -- for advanced metaprogramming and arbritary compile-time
   computation.

## Events

I have participated in programming contests, such as Google Hash Code, Google
Code Jam, Google Kickstart, MIUP and Battle of Universities.
