# Work Experience

## Internship at Accenture (July of 2019)

My assigned job was developing unfinished features, aswell as new features, for
a consumer facing product. These features entailed working with Augmented
Reality in iOS. In the process, I've also learned about the Scrum framework.

## Application Security Analyst at Checkmarx (September of 2019 - present)

My job as an analyst entails analysing existing security vulnerabilities, with
or without a CVE number, with the end goal being to learn which versions of the
affected software are actually vulnerable. Although I'm not tasked with
software development of any form, as vulnerabilities are found in a wide range
of projects, I come in contact with many languages, the most common being C,
Clojure, Java, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

# Education

Studied Computer Science at the University of Minho for a Bachelor's.

# Additional Information

## Programming Languages

From University and personal projects, the languages that I have experience
with, enjoyed working with, and would like to work with again:

 * C
 * Scheme
 * Erlang
 * Haskell

From reading books, papers and blogs, the languages that I would like to learn:

 * Rust -- safe systems language, with an advanced type system;
 * Idris -- for playing with types;
 * Common Lisp -- for advanced metaprogramming and arbritary compile-time
   computation;

## Events

I have participated in programming contests, such as Google Hash Code, Google
Code Jam, Google Kickstart, MIUP and Battle of Universities.

## Personal Projects

During my spare time I have developed personal projects and contributed to open
source projects. The most notable among them:

<https://github.com/siiky/c-utils>
  ~ Type-generic data structures and utilities written in C, tested with
  QuickCheck-like tests.

<https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags>
  ~ Found and fixed two `NULL`-dereference bugs.

<https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/cis>
  ~ Found and reported a bug.

<https://github.com/iraikov/chicken-unitconv>
  ~ Changed all constants to exact numbers, to improve precision.

## Areas of Interest

I have a special interest in functional and distributed programming and in code
quality, I believe low-level and performance to be very important aspects of
programming and programming languages, and because of this, the languages that
have caught my eyes most recently are CHICKEN Scheme and Rust.

I'm a proponent of the FLOSS movement and sharing of knowledge in general.
