# Education

Studied Computer Science at the University of Minho for a Bachelor's. Currently
enrolled at the University of Minho for my Master's degree in Informatics
Engineering.

# Professional Experience

## Internship at Accenture (July of 2019)

My assigned job was developing unfinished features, as well as new features,
for a consumer facing product. These features entailed working with Augmented
Reality in iOS. In the process, I've also learned about the Scrum framework.

## Application Security Analyst at Checkmarx (September of 2019 - present)

My job as an analyst consists in analysing existing security vulnerabilities,
with or without a CVE number, with the end goal being to learn which versions
of the affected software are actually vulnerable. Although I'm not tasked with
software development, apart from internal tools, as vulnerabilities are found
in a wide range of projects, I come in contact with many languages, the most
common being C, Clojure, Java, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

# Additional Information

## Programming Languages

From University and personal projects, the languages that I have experience
with, enjoyed working with, and would like to work with again:

 * Erlang
 * Scheme
 * C
 * Haskell

From reading books, papers and blogs, the languages that I would like to learn:

 * Elixir -- the "next-gen" Erlang, with lots of new features, and good
   tooling;
 * Rust -- safe systems language, with an advanced type system;
 * Idris -- for playing with types;
 * Go -- for simple concurrency management;
 * Common Lisp -- for advanced metaprogramming and arbritary compile-time
   computation.

## Events

I have participated in programming contests, such as Google Hash Code, Google
Code Jam, Google Kickstart, MIUP and Battle of Universities.

## Open Source Work

I have developed personal projects and contributed to open source projects,
mostly during my spare time. The most notable among them:

<https://github.com/siiky/c-utils>
 ~ Type-generic data structures and utilities written in C, tested with
   QuickCheck-like tests.

<https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags>
 ~ Found and fixed two `NULL`-dereference bugs.

<https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/cis>
 ~ Found and reported a bug in the set difference function.

<https://github.com/iraikov/chicken-unitconv>
 ~ Changed all constants to exact numbers, to improve precision.

<https://www.phpmyadmin.net>
 ~ Found and responsibly disclosed CVE-2020-26935 at work.

## Areas of Interest

I have a special interest in functional and distributed programming and in code
quality, I believe low-level and performance to be very important aspects of
programming and programming languages, and because of this, the languages that
have caught my eyes most recently are Elixir, CHICKEN Scheme, and Rust.

I'm a big proponent of the FLOSS movement and sharing of knowledge in general.
