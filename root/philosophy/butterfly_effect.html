<p>Everyone or almost everyone has heard that butterfly wings and
hurricanes have something to do with each other.</p>
<p>Whether they perceptibly have or not, small changes/actions have big
impacts, even if only for the simple adding-up of all of them.</p>
<p>So next time you have alternatives, one of them better than the
other, even if "it wouldn't make adifference any way", choose the better
option.</p>
<p>By "alternative" let it be understood something that is within your
reach. Flying over a cliff (rather than falling off it) when you
obviously can't fly is not an alternative. But paying some extra at your
local grocer rather than at the biggest supermarket chain probably
is.</p>
<hr />
<p>These are some of the personal goals in line with this idea:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Stop using Google Maps at all – help get OSM good enough for everyday
use</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Stop using FB messager (and WhatsApp) once and for all – already using
Signal (other than IRC &amp; email) almost exclusively</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Move away from YT – probably PeerTube or similar, or Invidious as last
resort</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Move to Sourcehut from GitHub – just missing the time; hopefully this
summer I'll have the time to move everything</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Stop using TIDAL</li>
</ul>
