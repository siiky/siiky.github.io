<p>I recently wrote about how <a
href="/philosophy/flexibility-life.html">flexibility may be beneficial
in your course of life</a>.</p>
<p>I've thought some times in the past how after I present myself in
some way, I can no longer present myself some other (conflicting) way in
the future to the same person(s). At least not with some friction.</p>
<p>In this post I'd like to write about that, yet another aspect of life
where flexibility can be useful (and possibly a hindrance!): human
relations.</p>
<hr />
<p>I first came across a similar idea (maybe when I first thought about
this, in fact) reading one of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes">Descartes</a>' <a
href="/books/list.html">books</a> – either <em>Discourse on the
Method</em> or <em>Selections from the Principles of Philosophy</em>, I
can't remember. In that book he wrote that there were works he didn't
want to publish during his lifetime.¹ <em>Wut? why?</em> He explains
that his works were often controversial due to the nature of their
content – religion and God were particularly controversial² – and by not
publishing them he could continue with his life and work without any
impediments (read: being imprisoned and/or killed).</p>
<hr />
<p>If you tell a friend one day that you like a nice and hot <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churro"><em>churro</em></a> (or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fartura_(food)"><em>fartura</em></a>,
the inferior alternative), you can't then tell them the next day that
you <em>don't</em> like it, right? It doesn't make sense! It can look
like you lied or are lying now.</p>
<p>Think of knowledge as a (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent">consistent</a> i.e. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction">non-contradictory</a>)
set of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition">propositions</a>. From
this point of view, acquiring knowledge is performing the set-union of
the current propositions with the new. If a person knows that you like
churros (<code class="verbatim">P</code>), and learns later that you
<em>don't</em> like churros (<code class="verbatim">¬P</code>), their
knowledge becomes inconsistent: <code class="verbatim">{ P, ¬P }</code>
is inconsistent, because <code class="verbatim">P ∧ ¬P</code> is a
contradiction!</p>
<p>Of course, people can change their opinions, tastes, and whatnot – it
was supposed so just now – but it's a slow process, slow enough not to
be flexible, the point of this post and the previous one.</p>
<p><em>So what's it mean?</em> If you're of an opinion now that (you
think) you're likely to change in the future, then… maybe you're better
off not sharing it with others right now?</p>
<p>Because, if you change opinion in the future, it'll take time for
people to adjust their knowledge set to your newly changed opinion;
people will judge you hard if said opinion is controversial or doesn't
go down their throats well; and, if you change opinion in the future,
whatever negative side-effects came of your sharing it were most likely
a net loss – waste of time and energy, at best.</p>
<p>There's a caveat, though. I'm here advocating that it may be a good
idea to refrain from sharing details about yourself with other people –
and I don't make any distinctions between close or not. But if you do it
too much, especially with a close relation, the other person won't know
that much about you, which may mean the relation isn't that great, and
it may end because of it.</p>
<p>And a possible alternative to the all-or-nothing: <em>very
clearly</em> stating that this opinion of yours is something prone to
change, something you are thinking of/working on right now, but are not
quite sure about just yet.</p>
<p>I think this might be kinda hard to pull off. People may think you're
saying that just as an escape route in case shit hits the fan, for
example. But I couldn't possibly guess all the weird ways people might
think, the same way I couldn't possibly guess all the ways shit might
hit the fan.</p>
<p>Just another tool in the toolbox… Maybe. Or not.

<p>¹ There are cons to this, such as not discussing with as many people,
but he was a pretty good thinker – he had a strict method for reasoning,
which was the subject of one of the two books (probably <em>Discourse on
the Method</em> judging by the title). On top of that (IIRC) he had a
few close relations with whom to discuss the more controversial
topics.</p>
<p>² Not that they somehow went against the state of affairs of the
time. He believed in God, (one of them is supposed to be a proof it
exists) and was religious (even supported the church IIRC).</p>
