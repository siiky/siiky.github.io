<p>To be able to <a href="/psychology/fagot.html">withstand the punches
life throws at you</a>, being flexible is helpful, methinks. It allows
you to focus on what matters to you, overlook what doesn't, and to dodge
them punches like a pro. Not only that, but you can more easily
experiment with things and try to find what works best. <em>"If you
don't have the room to fail, you only have the room to remain"</em> (if
it almost rhymes it's true, amirite?)</p>
<p>Let me try to explain what I mean.</p>
<hr />
<p>From my very limitted knowledge of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy">Chinese
philosophy</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts">martial arts
philosophy</a> (<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: I'm not a student or
practitioner), before anything else, what you need most is
flexibility.</p>
<p>From the <a href="/books/list.html"><em>Tao Te Ching</em></a> (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Wikipedia</a>) the
main takeway I got is that you'll have a hard time if you go against
nature – certainly harder than if you go along it. If you're lucky (or
maybe strong enough?) that's all it will be, harder; more likely,
however, you'll simply lose.</p>
<p>Thus, from my (very likely wrong and/or incomplete) understanding,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao"><em>Tao</em></a> is to
go with nature, accept nature, go with the flow, accept things as they
are and that they're rarely as you'd prefer them to be, that what
happens through your course of life will happen whether you like it or
not, and that often you have no say in it – what will be, will be (this
isn't some "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate">fate</a>" BS or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism"><em>hard
determinism</em></a>, though it may sound like it the way I put it; more
at the end).</p>
<p>A similar idea exists in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi"><em>Tai Chi</em></a>
boxing, where you don't fight your oponent with force, but by trying to
deflect their attacks, using their nature against them.</p>
<p>And what better way is there to "go with the flow" than by being
flexible in your moves and in your mind?</p>
<hr />
<p>More practically (but not necessarily by the <em>Tao</em>) I think of
it as avoiding unnecessary (unnatural) imposed limits or goals; or as
distilling what I really enjoy from what I don't (as much). Such that I
may focus on what matters to me most without getting overly lost on
"trivialities".</p>
<p>For example, some decades ago someone <em>declared</em> that "you
must eat every 3h~4h and must not go many hours without eating" (I can't
remember who nor why; have to research). Similarly, someone once
<em>declared</em> that "breakfast is the most important meal of the day
and so must also be the heaviest/fullest" (this one I do remember: <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/28/breakfast-health-america-kellog-food-lifestyle">Kellogg's
and some bacon company</a>). I purposefully say "declared" because this
wasn't the result of a scientific study or some other method. Saying a
bunch of bullshit nobody pays heed to is quite alright – no harm done,
right? The problem is that these "truths" are actually accepted as
truths in (at least some of) today's western society!</p>
<p>Let's imagine some scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>You feel hungry, but you don't eat (let's say because you
can't).</li>
<li>You don't feel hungry, and you don't eat (no matter why).</li>
<li>You don't feel hungry, but you eat anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not talking here about people that starve. I'm assuming you're
skipping only one, maybe two, meals at most. <strong>Actually starving
is serious, and I'm not trying in any way to downplay its
seriousness!</strong></p>
<p>If you don't believe in any of the declared crap, all's fine, you
just go on with your day, in any of the 3 scenarios. But what if you do
believe it?</p>
<p>In (1) and (2), what's actually worse for your health: the fact that
you haven't eaten, or that you're stressing because you believe it's bad
you haven't eaten (whether you feel hungry or not)?</p>
<p>In (1), what's worse: the fact that you haven't eaten, or that you're
stressing because you feel hungry?</p>
<p>In (3) whatever food you have is arguably unnecessary – your body
didn't feel it necessary, at least. It may simply be extra food to make
you fatter.</p>
<p>And particulars matter, of course. If you do hard physical work,
skipping a meal may be enough to have you pass out after a while. But
many people nowadays <em>don't</em>. And many eat <strong>tons</strong>
of food. Food that they don't need. For them, skipping a meal or even
two, as long as they don't feel ill/weak because of it, is very likely
OK.</p>
<hr />
<p>This deviated a bit… To get back on track: in these scenarios, is the
food what really matters? This is possibly the most important question.
I argue that it <strong>isn't</strong> – you can survive the scenarios
after all, and easily at that! On top of it, <strong>there's nothing you
can do right now</strong> to improve the situation.</p>
<p>So what do you think the better use of your energy is: worrying about
something you can easily survive, or worrying about or enjoying
something else that matters to you, something you like, something you
want?</p>
<p>I also realize that it may not feel easy, especially when you're
feeling hungry; and that worrying more "productively" may not come
naturally to you – the opposite may be the case. But it is possible to
train yourself. It is possible to condition yourself, distract yourself
from the (easily survivable) unpleasant feeling. We weren't raised up
thus. In western society we learn that splurging is the way. And so we
do. But it feels uneasy when we can't, like it shouldn't be possible. We
simply haven't learned how to deal with it.</p>
<hr />
<p>To try to examplify how being free of these self-restrains gives you
the needed freedom to experiment, I'll go with food again (I don't know
why, it's just what's popping into my head).</p>
<p>If you go travelling, you should try to enjoy the place as much as
possible while you're still there – this should be obvious?</p>
<p>Let's say that you plan a walk at this place that may be completely
unknown to you. You found some guides or whatever, you decided to go
here and there, and you marked possible food stops (like restaurants or
cafes).</p>
<p>Alas! The guides were outdated and the food places are closed! Quick!
What do you do?</p>
<p>Should have been easy if you read it all thus far:
¯\_<sub>(ツ)</sub>_/¯ go with it, no big deal, it's not a showstopper!
Carry on with your plan, visit what other places you planned to visit.
Enjoy them as much as you would weren't the food places closed. After
the walk you can be sure you'll enjoy the food even more.</p>
<p>The alternatives I can think of: continue with the rest of the plan
but be stuck with "oh no, I have no food!", thus not enjoying the walk;
or abort the rest of the plan to go for food instead. Shit alternatives
if you ask me…</p>
<hr />
<p>This is getting long enough, but finally: no, the <em>Tao</em> isn't
an excuse to sit back and watch the time go by, and indeed, I'm in favor
of the opposite. So why do I think it's, as I described it at the top,
not just some "fate" BS or <em>hard determinism</em>?</p>
<p>Because it isn't about what's gonna happen in the future. In no way
does the <em>Tao</em> say that nature is the determining force of the
future; or that if you do <em>this</em> thing <em>that</em> thing will
happen. Only that things have an innate nature, a pre-disposition, a way
of behaving and acting that feels <em>right</em>, if you will, for both
animate and inanimate entities; and that you should try to learn of that
way, both yours and your environment's, and how best they can coexist
and/or cooperate.</p>
<p>The best practical example I can think of is physics. It certainly is
easier to let gravity do its thing than to go against it – ever tried
jumping and remaining in the air? Not that easy, right? – but if you
don't go against it, ever, you'll go nowhere. On the flip side of the
coin, if you feel so strongly against it that you can only brood over
it, you'll also go nowhere, it'll be miserable. Thus, the way
(<em>Tao</em> means "way" or "path", by the way) is through the middle
ground, where you and your surroundings can meet.</p>
<p>Little side-note: in my view, this is one of the ideas that lead me
to believe the best way of life is the one that ruffles leaves the least
(in number and ruffled-ness). With regards to the planet specifically, I
think that we should be striving to the best of our abilities not to
screw it.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that's that. I spent a good workday of time on this, totally
worth it! Feels like I beat a dead horse a bit, though… :/</p>
