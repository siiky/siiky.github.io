<p>What if there was a way to force oneself to donate?</p>
<p>Donating to projects you use, enjoy, or believe in, is a way to help
ensure their sustainability. However, for some reason that I haven't
figured out yet, it's hard to get going. Won't try to speak for anyone
else, but as for me, there's always a <em>what if</em>, such as, what if
I had donated to this instead of that? what if this turns out to be
<em>evil</em>?</p>
<p>My mom, who earns less than half of what I earn in a month, used to
donate more than me. I can't believe I'm unique in that; I'm sure there
are many people out there that can donate, that is, they have the
monetary power, but that don't.</p>
<p>Think of everything that you use or have used for free, think only of
things that are distributed freely by their creators and that you
haven't paid for nor donated to; realize that it took effort to create
it, and that otherwise, e.g. with a book or a movie, you'd have to buy
and pay for it somewhere; given that you haven't paid for it, it should
be obvious that you're committing "theft".</p>
<p>Assuming that we are ethical and/or want to be ethical, theft is
probably on everyone's naughty list, so it's something everyone wants to
avoid.</p>
<p>I understand that this is so oversimplified it almost couldn't be at
all helpful. And I'm sure I've overlooked many aspects of the whole
situation.</p>
<p>But this isn't supposed to be some very deep philosophical thinking.
It's just a bit of rhetoric to try and convince people to donate to
things they enjoy and would like to keep afloat.</p>
<p>Using rhetoric to improve peopleâ€¦ I bet Plato (<a

didn't see that coming!</p>
