<h1>Post dates</h1>

<p>Until now, I'd never &quot;standardized&quot; what the dates on my site mean, even though I've been consistent with them everywhere (not much to screw up anyway): both on the index and the posts themselves, the dates are always when I started writing the post (or created the file, at least). So there are unfinished (unstarted, even) posts that, were I to finish and publish, would get the date I first created them on the index. This isn't great. And something similarly ungreat happens with posts that I take a long time to write (actually actively writing), sometimes across a few days of a week -- the post has a certain date, but in reality it's published only some days later -- usually leading to interleaving of posts: start post A, start post B, publish post B, publish post A.</p>
<p>I started thinking about this because I've been lurking Geminispace for a bit now, and liking it a lot! So I'm planning on writing in Gemtext from now on, instead of Markdown or Org, and convert my site to a Gemini capsule (still making HTML available through HTTP(S) for anyone not with it &lt;insert Dr. Evil reference here&gt;). Turning the index, which is one of the most complex parts of my site, into a simple Gemtext page, is just... hmhmhm! And, other than the index being the front-page, serving at the same time as the &quot;feed&quot; that people can subscribe to is also just... hmhmhm!</p>
<p>But with that comes a problem, because I update posts, some more than others, some days more than others, but, posts don't necessarily remain as they were first published. Because of it, and of the interleaving I mentioned above, I'll start using a new convention -- slightly harder to maintain, but if I don't screw up should be worth it:</p>
<p>Posts themselves will have the date of when I first started writing or first created the file, while the index (feed) will have the date of the last update instead. This way (though I still have to test how clients behave) should give no jumps to the past when I publish new posts, and at the same time works as an updates notifier.</p>
