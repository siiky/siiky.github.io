<p>Finished reading Ch. 3 &amp; 4 some weeks ago.</p>
<p>On Ch. 3 there wasn't that much new to me – notation was slightly
different from what I was used to, but in general it wasn't complicated
to follow. There was terminology I didn't remember too, but mostly just
had to go back and read my notes from University.</p>
<p>Ch. 4, however, was an interesting one. They define two categories:
one of Petri nets (called <code class="verbatim">Petri</code>), with
nets as objects; and another of Petri net executions for a given net
(called <code class="verbatim">F(N)</code>, with some Petri net <code
class="verbatim">N</code>, and a fancy calligraphic <code
class="verbatim">F</code>), with markings as objects.</p>
<hr />
<p>A morphism <code class="verbatim">N -&gt; M</code> of <code
class="verbatim">Petri</code> is a pair <code
class="verbatim">〈f, g〉</code> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">f</code> is a function between the
transitions of <code class="verbatim">N</code> and those of <code
class="verbatim">M</code> (<code
class="verbatim">T_N -&gt; T_M</code>)</li>
<li><code class="verbatim">g</code> is a multiset homomorphism between
the markings(?) of both nets</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, these morphisms must preserve a couple of
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="verbatim">°(-)_M . f = g . °(-)_N</code></li>
<li><code class="verbatim">(-)°_M . f = g . (-)°_N</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I can't explain these in words right now, so… exercise for the
reader!</p>
<p>But I'll try anyway with an example: suppose that <code
class="verbatim">f</code> transforms transitions in such a way that they
consume and produce double the amount of tokens, and that <code
class="verbatim">g</code> doubles the amount of tokens of each place;
then, if a particular place <code class="verbatim">p_N</code> of the net
<code class="verbatim">N</code> has 2 tokens, and a transition <code
class="verbatim">t_N</code> that consumes 2 tokens from <code
class="verbatim">p_N</code>, there's a place <code
class="verbatim">p_M</code> with 4 tokens, and a transition <code
class="verbatim">t_M</code> that consumes 4 tokens from <code
class="verbatim">p_M</code>.</p>
<p>Altogether, I think these form a sort of super/subnet relation
between nets, that visually looks a lot like super/subgraphs.</p>
<p>The category <code class="verbatim">Petri</code> is actually
restricted to a subcategory (<code class="verbatim">Petri_G</code>),
which is the one used in practice, but I think the details aren't
relevant for this post (it has to do with the <code
class="verbatim">g</code>, if you wish to know).</p>
