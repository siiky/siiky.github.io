Finished reading Ch. 3 & 4 some weeks ago.

On Ch. 3 there wasn't that much new to me -- notation was slightly different
from what I was used to, but in general it wasn't complicated to follow. There
was terminology I didn't remember too, but mostly just had to go back and read
my notes from University.

Ch. 4, however, was an interesting one. They define two categories: one of Petri
nets (called =Petri=), with nets as objects; and another of Petri net executions
for a given net (called =F(N)=, with some Petri net =N=, and a fancy
calligraphic =F=), with markings as objects.

-----

A morphism =N -> M= of =Petri= is a pair =〈f, g〉= where:

+ =f= is a function between the transitions of =N= and those of =M= (=T_N -> T_M=)
+ =g= is a multiset homomorphism between the markings(?) of both nets

Additionally, these morphisms must preserve a couple of properties:

+ =°(-)_M . f = g . °(-)_N=
+ =(-)°_M . f = g . (-)°_N=

I can't explain these in words right now, so... exercise for the reader!

But I'll try anyway with an example: suppose that =f= transforms transitions in
such a way that they consume and produce double the amount of tokens, and that
=g= doubles the amount of tokens of each place; then, if a particular place
=p_N= of the net =N= has 2 tokens, and a transition =t_N= that consumes 2 tokens
from =p_N=, there's a place =p_M= with 4 tokens, and a transition =t_M= that
consumes 4 tokens from =p_M=.

Altogether, I think these form a sort of super/subnet relation between nets,
that visually looks a lot like super/subgraphs.

The category =Petri= is actually restricted to a subcategory (=Petri_G=), which
is the one used in practice, but I think the details aren't relevant for this
post (it has to do with the =g=, if you wish to know).
