<p>I started studying <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net">Petri nets</a> a few
weeks ago, reading the <a href="https://statebox.org">Statebox</a> <a
href="https://statebox.org/research/publications/monograph">monograph</a>
(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07629">ArXiv</a>), and just
finished today reading Ch. 2, the formalization of Petri nets and useful
definitions.</p>
<p>At first I didn't understand the point of having places (seemingly
analogous to "states" in more common automata theories) and transitions
(analogous to arrows in more common automata theories) as disjunctive
sets of nodes of a graph – other than the obvious advantage of it being
easier to specify several inputs/outputs of a transition. Plus, there's
no current "state" (the mentioned places) – it's very different from
other more common automata theories! Not only that, but what they call a
"state" is the number of tokens in each place – what?</p>
<p>Once I saw Fig. 2.8 and 2.9, however, it clicked: A transitions is
<em>enabled</em> (can <em>fire</em>, "execute") if its input tokens can
be satisfied by all its input places. So what's currently a valid "step"
in the system is determined by the number of tokens in each place, just
like the "current state" of other automata determines the possible next
transitions. <em>And</em>, several transitions may execute
simultaneously (as long as their executions don't prevent each
other)!</p>
<p>Yesterday and today were good days in this regard. I now understand
how Petri nets can represent concurrent/parallel behaviour, because
transitions are like independent "processes" (a la Erlang); and that
places are more like variables, or resources, possibly shared between
many transitions (processes).</p>
<p>On <a href="https://petrinet.org">this site</a>, which is referenced
right at the end of Ch. 2, you can read the basics of the basics and
play with some simple nets (unfortunately only with already defined
ones; you can't define new ones or change those of the website).</p>
