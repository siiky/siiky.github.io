<p>Crazy idea: what if instead of selling plastic bottles, stores sold
water by the litre, similarly to how gas is sold by the litre? People
would BYOB, be it plastic, metal, or glass, and fill it up.</p>
<p>I know some places already do this, or have something similar, but
it's not that widespread.</p>
