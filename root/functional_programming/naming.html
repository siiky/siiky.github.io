<h1>Naming Operations rather than Variables</h1>

<p>Naming, using, reading, and understanding well named operations rather than (kinda) well named variables grows the habit of reading and understanding code rather than relying on variables being well named -- and everyone knows naming is hard.</p>
<p>Bad:</p>
<pre><code>x = '42'
x_food = foo(x)
x_bard_food = bar(x_food)
x_zazd_bard_food = zaz(x_bard_food)
</code></pre>
<p>Good (using procedural composition):</p>
<pre><code>x = zaz(bar(foo('42')))
</code></pre>
<p>Better (if the chain of operations is long):</p>
<pre><code>x = '42'
x = foo(x)
x = bar(x)
x = zaz(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Best (using functional composition):</p>
<pre><code>(=&gt; '42'
    foo
    bar
    zaz)

; OR

((-&gt; foo bar zaz) '42')
</code></pre>
<p>It also comes with rather nice advantages. Just compare the two approaches in each scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you want to change the order of operations in the chain;</li>
<li>Imagine you want to add an operation to the chain;</li>
<li>Imagine you want to remove an operation from the chain.</li></ul>
<p>And a final bonus: the &quot;better&quot; approach is easier to read than the &quot;bad&quot; approach, and requires less typing, thank you very much.</p>
