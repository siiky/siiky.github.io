# Care list

If you don't know what IPFS is or don't know how to use it, see this quickstart:

=> ipfs.gmi

IPFS root directory of this list:

=> ipfs://bafybeicsuo27ufnhjw2k5ophno5hgxhuvfbzzerrgsx7fxmy4kxwthpkbi

Because sharing is caring. This is a list of things I'm caring with others. Some of the types of cares you may find here are books from Gutenberg or Standard Ebooks that I particularly like; public movies/documentaries I find interesting and/or important; and copies of technical material distributed publicly and freely by their creators. Whatever care you may find here, it shouldn't be illegal.

=> https://www.gutenberg.org Gutenberg
=> https://standardebooks.org Standard Ebooks

You'll find at least three spider cares.

The URI of the root of the list will be always at the top of the page (the "IPFS root directory ..."). From it you can get to all other cares (if I don't screw up). Over the rest of the page I'll post some notable cares and/or (maybe) more details -- maybe even sources!

The cares are added to IPFS using `ipfs add` with the options `--recursive --raw-leaves --cid-version=1`. Videos also get a `--trickle `. The full command is something like this:

```
ipfs files cp /ipfs/`ipfs add -p -Q -r -t --pin=false --cid-version=1 --raw-leaves '/path/to/file_or_directory'` '/care-list/videos/file_or_directory'
```

If you feel the urge to support someone after finding or benefitting from this list, support the creators of the cares themselves.
