<p>There are some types of work or achievements at work that can be
credited directly to one person or small group of people. I don’t mean
fixing bugs or developing some new fancy useless feature, but, for
example, a new revolutionary algorithm, protocol, or cryptographic
system. This may or may not be a part of their job. Sometimes a white
paper about the novelty is written and published; and sometimes it
isn’t. In either case, it is not uncommon for the matter to break out on
news and social media sites. The titles usually go something like
“$COMPANY does $BIGTHING”. Is this right?</p>
<p>A few months ago news with a title somewhat similar to the above
broke out, and the company was the one I work for. It was really big
news, and all thanks to the work of a group of two or three people in
the company. Not anyone else. What name is mentioned in the title? The
<em>company</em>’s. Who did the work? The nameless group inside the
company.</p>
<p>One day, at lunch, the topic came up because of something the head of
that small group said in an interview, when asked “What are your
comments about $COMPANY having done $BIGTHING?”: “Has it?”. This coming
up, almost at once, everyone got (figuratively) up, as if someone had
insulted $PERSONALDEITY inside $DESIGNATEDPLACEOFWORSHIPOFSAIDDEITY. And
I just really don’t get it. Why would anyone think it’s right to credit
the <em>company</em> instead of the people who’ve actually done the
thing? How can a <em>company</em>, not being a being, not in the
possession of reason, not being able to take an action, not being able
to affect the real physical world, possibly accomplish any a thing?</p>
<p>Maybe I’m being a bit harsh on companies, but I believe crediting
something or someone for something it or they haven’t done is not right.
I would say, if anything, the only credit companies deserve is for doing
<em><strong>The Right Thing (TM)</strong></em> in investing on someone
competent and deserving of remuneration.</p>
