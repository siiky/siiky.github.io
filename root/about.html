<h2>About</h2>
<p>Online I go by siiky, silky, or other derivatives. You can find me most often on #chicken@libera.chat -- feel free to PM if you so wish.</p>
<p>My repositories can be found on SourceHut. I'm slowly moving away from GitHub but you can still find stuff there.</p>

There will inevitably be some content that wasn't produced by me but that I forgot to credit correctly -- my bad! Such content is obviously not released under terms chosen by me.</p>
