<p>Finished reading <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Avoid_a_Climate_Disaster">this
book</a> recently (ISBN 978-0-241-44830-4) and in this post I want to
share my opinions/critique, and try to compile all the notes I took
while and after reading.</p>
<p>I'll put down page numbers in this post. If you have the same
edition, cool, if not: the <em>Introduction</em> starts on p3, and
<em>Climate Change and COVID-19</em> ends on p230. Hopefully that will
help getting around. For figures and tables you can try the
<em>Notes</em> where you can find the sources and corresponding
page.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts on the book in general, or the things I
got out of it. Maybe you won't agree with them, but <em>that's life</em>
(insert Frank Sinatra reference here).</p>
<h2 id="tone">Tone</h2>
<p>First off, this is kinda personal preference, what makes me tick or
makes me cringe, but I didn't like the overall tone and his
unquestionably stating that "progress" is good.</p>
<p>My impression, from reading this book alone, is that he
<strong>really</strong> believes that the incresing consumerism of
resources – be they electricity, water, minerals/metals, &amp;c – is a
good thing, especially by "the poor", as he puts it.</p>
<p>The exact thing that got us into this, he thinks should be liberally
given to and used by "the poor". So that they can wreck their own
countries/land/habitat? Is this rational?</p>
<p>The ackownledgements chapter even has a <strong>huge</strong> list of
people that supposedly contributed to the inception of the book in some
way or another, including several researchers, professors, and renowned
authors in the matter. Is it just me thinking about this? Or am I
missing something that everyone else knows about?</p>
<p>It's almost funny after he mentioned David Foster Wallace's <em>This
Is Water</em> (more later).</p>
<p>This is related to some of the themes discussed in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_at_Dawn"><em>Sex at
Dawn</em></a> from my point of view.</p>
<h2 id="pollution-of-greener-alternatives">Pollution of "greener"
alternatives</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole book he continuously advocates for green
energies (like solar and wind) and alternatives (like electric vehicles)
but fails to mention even once the polution involved in their
production, and the fact that the current products/methods are not
recyclable (see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Pitron"><em>The Dark Side
of Green Energies</em></a>).</p>
<h2 id="green-premium">Green premium</h2>
<p>Didn't know the <em>green premium</em> term – the extra price paid
for greener alternatives. (I was familiar with the concept of course,
just not the term)</p>
<h2 id="reflect-cost-in-price">Reflect cost in price</h2>
<p>I like the idea of raising/lowering the price of something based on
its environmental impact, thus better reflecting the true cost of
something, and simultaneously discouraging "bad" alternatives over
"good" alternatives.</p>
<p>The difficulty would be convincing people that this is a good thing.
During the transition, the average Joe probably won't be interested in
the fact the new thing is better for the environment but rather that
what they're using currently became more expensive. In my view, this is
of course irrational – negative effects on the environment negatively
affect everyone in the long run. But it's not something easy to convince
someone of, and I for sure commit the same mistake occasionally.</p>
<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<p>Some of his statements are not backed by any sources, you're supposed
(I guess?) to just believe in his authority on the matter and go with
it. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>money spent/saved over some period of time when comparing
alternatives – e.g. planting mangrove trees rather than not saves the
world $80B/year;</li>
<li>the amount of energy provided per amount of energy consumed by
produced chickens, pigs, and cows (1/2, 1/3, 1/6, respectively,
according to him); don't know if that's the meat alone, or if it
includes eggs and milk;</li>
<li>the amount of CO2 absorbed by a tree during its lifetime – "a good
rule of thumb is 4 tons over the course 40 years."</li>
</ul>
<p>At least graphs and the like usually have sources.</p>
<h1 id="chapters">Chapters</h1>
<p>Didn't take notes on some of the chapters, so obviously those aren't
here. But just because it may be of interest, here's the index with
shitty formatting:</p>

<h2 id="why-zero"><em>Why Zero?</em></h2>
<p>We went from almost 0 (in 1850) to almost 40 billion (in 2018) tons
of CO2 (emitted per year, I suppose). (fig p24) The figure includes also
the rise of the average temperature over the years.</p>
<h2 id="this-will-be-hard"><em>This Will Be Hard</em></h2>
<p>From <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster
Wallace</a>'s speech <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water"><em>This Is
Water</em></a> (p37-38):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to
meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says,
"Morning, boys, how's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a
bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes,
"What the hell is water?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David's explanation (p38):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The immediate point of the fish story is that the most obvious,
ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that are the hardest
to see and talk about.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Many farmers still have to use ancient techniques, which is one of
the reasons they're trapped in poverty. They deserve modern equipment
and approaches, but right now using those tools means producing more
greenhouse gases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(fig p43) Why assume that <em>we</em> are the superior ones and that
<em>they</em> have to "progress"? Until 1850 (according to fig p24) we
barely made a dent to the climate. How can you assume that "progressing"
was a good thing? Even agriculture may have been a mistake (<em>Sex at
Dawn</em>)!</p>

<p>Human activities and their percentage of greenhouse gases emitted
(tbl p55; src: none). He gives a definition of what goes where in a
footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These percentages represent global greenhouse gas emissions. When
you're categorizing emissions from various sources, one of the questions
you have to decide is how to count products that cause emissions both
when you make them and when you use them. For example, we produce
greenhouse gases when we refine oil into gasoline and again when we burn
the gasoline. In this book, I've included all the emissions from making
things in "How we make things" and all the emissions from using them in
their respective categories. So oil refining goes under "How we make
things," and burning gasoline is included in "How we get around." The
same goes for things like cars, planes, and ships. The steel that
they're made of is counted under "How we make things," and the emissions
from the fuels they burn go under "How we get around."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This (tbl p55) was possibly the most unexpected thing I learned from
the book. I didn't expect at all for production of materials to be at
the top and electricity next. Even more for food (mainly animals) being
worse than transport. Just shows how well (un)informed I am (or
was)…</p>

<p>Analogy with cars about how we stopped using and researching nuclear
energy because of the past accidents. (p86)</p>
<p>It goes both ways too. We stopped using nuclear because of the
accidents, but even though the other energy sources result in more
deaths per unit of energy (tbl p85), we prefer using those.</p>

Some marketing words (mainly for me to read about later): <a

<p>I used to scoff at the idea that using power more efficiently would
make a dent in climate change. My rationale: If you have limited
resources to reduce emitions (and we do), then you'd get the biggest
impact by moving to zero emissions rather than by spending a lot trying
to reduce the demand for energy.</p>

<p>A comment about using less energy. (p95) Is it dumb or what? The
following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything that reduces the scale we need to reach is helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(p96) Whouldathunkit! Finally he says something more sensible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's also a related approach called load shifting or demand
shifting, which involves using power more consistently throughout the
day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(p96) This sounds like a <em>very</em> good idea, for the reason he
states afterwards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now, we tend to generate power when we use it – for example,
cranking up electric plants to run a city's light at night. With load
shifting, though, we do the opposite: we use more electricity when it's
cheapest to generate.</p>

<p>After exposing how "growing" animals (significantly) contributes to
global warming and how greenhouse gases come to be from this practice,
and of ways to work around that or improve the situation (such as
bioengineering animals to not produce greenhouse gases), this comes
along:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hard-core vegan might propose another solution: <em>Instead of
trying all these ways of reducing emissions, we should just stop raising
livestock.</em> I can see the appeal of that argument, but I don't think
it's realistic. For one thing, meat plays too important a role in human
culture. In many parts of the world, even where it's scarce, eating meat
is a crucial part of festivals and celebrations. In France, the
gastronomic meal – including started, meat or fish, cheese, and dessert
– is officially listed as part of the country's Intangible Cultural
Heritage of Humanity. According to the listing on the UNESCO website,
"The gastronomic meal emphasizes togetherness, the pleasure of taste,
and the balance between human beings and the products of nature"</p>

(p118-119)</p>
<p><em><strong>What the fuck?</strong></em></p>
<p>1st WTF: "hard-core vegan"? I'm pretty sure a vegan doesn't have to
be hardcore to be of that opinion.</p>
<p>2nd WTF: "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage">Cultural
Heritage</a>"? My brain goes <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_says_no"><em>computer says
no</em></a> with this… The culture we're leaving behind – possibly
literally – is to destroy what made it possible to exist in the first
place?</p>
<p>3rd WTF: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unesco">UNESCO</a>?
Aren't these the guys behind the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals">SDGs</a>
("Sustainable Development Goals" – quotes super apropes)?</p>
<p>The same guys that put "Climate action", "Life below water", and
"Life on land" as <em>almost</em> the least important goals (13, 14, and
15, respectively – out of 17 – <a
href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Sustainable_Development_Goals.svg">pic</a>)?
So much for sustainable…</p>
<p>The same guys that put water (6) as less important than poverty (1),
food (2), health &amp; well being (3), quality education (4), and gender
equality (5)? Yes, everybody knows you all your thirsts with knowledge
quench! And what not…</p>
<p>And what the hell are "No poverty" (1), "Responsible consumption and
production" (12) and "Partnerships for the goals" (17), anyway? Couldn't
they have been any vaguer?</p>
<p>(To be fair, I haven't read each of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sustainable_Development_Goal_targets_and_indicators">goals'
descriptions</a>)</p>
<p>4th WTF: "togetherness"? You have to eat an animal (or animal
product) to feel close to other people, like your friends and family?
Reminds me of <a
href="https://www.flashforwardpod.com/2016/08/10/episode-19-wheres-the-beef">this
episode of FlashForward</a> where a listener/commenter(?) said "a sunday
isn't a sunday without my chicken wings" or something of the sort. Ok,
then… Maybe I'm really so very abnormally undemanding, but I'm good with
a (literal) walk in the park.</p>
<p>5th WTF: "pleasure of taste"? Hmmm… Let's see. How do you season your
meat or fish? Salt (lit. some rock out of sea water)? Spices (plants,
seeds, roots, …)? Butter (very likely margerine – plant)? Some garlic
(plant) and/or onion (plant)? Maybe some alcoholic beverage (wine –
grapes; beer – cereals; vodka – cereals/potatoes; rum – sugarcanes)? Why
use so many non-animal products if the said "pleasure of taste" is due
to the meat? Admittedly, nowhere does it say that the "pleasure of
taste" is due to the meat; but why would it be mentioned otherwise?</p>
<p>6th WTF: "balance between human beings and the products of nature"?
Must have been a typo for sure: "inbalance". And yes, good thing we, the
good, well intentioned humans, are here to consume all the products of
nature, otherwise they would all go to waste! And y'all know that waste
is a sin! Oh wait…</p>
<p>This must be the most stupidestest paragraph of the entire book… He
does say he enjoys a good burger, but it would be only an assumption, of
course, to think that this is his opinion or that he's just sharing
something he's heard. Plus, he also says he has invested in two
companies working on "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_substitutes">plant-based
meat</a>": <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_meat"><em>Beyond
Meat</em></a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods"><em>Impossible

it's plant-based then it's not meat – but whatever, after that
paragraph…)</p>

<p>The tone of the book really did turn me off a bit… But that's
probably just me. Other than that, a really big omission is that of the
pollution of "greener" alternatives. However, to give him some credit,
he seems to really be invested in the problem and to be investing some
phat $$$ into it.</p>
<p>Whether it's worth reading for you depends on you, however. If you're
well into the topic, you probably learned nothing from this post, and in
that case maybe you won't learn nothing from the book that's
significantly worth it either. On the other hand, if you're leaving this
post more informed than you were before, you may want to give the book a
try.</p>
