<p>This one is somewhat longer, and it’s not someone’s or some
character’s quote, but it’s a good paragraph from a good book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A New Theory of Biology” was the title of the paper which Mustapha
Mond had just finished reading. He sat for some time, meditatively
frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page. “The
author’s mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel
and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social
order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. <em>Not to be
published</em>.” He underlined the words. “The author will be kept under
supervision. His transference to the Marine Biological Station of St
Helena may become necessary.” A pity, he thought, as he signed his name.
It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting
explanations in terms of purpose – well, you didn’t know what the result
might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily recondition the more
unsettled minds among the higher castes – make them lose their faith in
happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the
goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside of the present human
sphere; that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being,
but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement
of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true.
But not, in the present circumstances, admissible. He picked up his pen
again, and under the words <em>“Not to be published”</em> drew a second
line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed. “What fun it
would be,” he thought, “if one didn’t have to think about
happiness!”</p>

<h1 id="section-7"></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>God’s power we allow is infinite: But neither man nor any other
animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom
is infinite: He is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But
the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it
is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human
knowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than
these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the
benevolence and mercy of men?</p>
