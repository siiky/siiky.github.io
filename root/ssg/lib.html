<p>SSG was originally written as a CLI program. You would call it with
the description of your site through arguments and external files. The
arguments would tell it where to look for source files, and the index
would tell it which source files to include in the site index. This is
very simple, and works pretty well; I can’t complain! But maybe only
because I made it this way, to fit this particular site. If I wanted to
change the site structure significantly, it would require changing SSG’s
internals, probably CLI arguments, CLI arguments parsing, … There’s
probably a better way!</p>
<p>I’ll try to change how SSG works, allowing more flexibility, maybe
even better performance, while not forcing anything on anyone! From now
on, you don’t generate your site by describing it through CLI arguments
and external files. Your site is not generated by <em>some</em> site
generator; your site is generated by <em>your</em> site generator!</p>
<p>Can it be done?</p>
