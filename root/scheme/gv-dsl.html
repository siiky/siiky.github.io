<p>I’ve (loosely) defined a DSL to represent GraphViz DOT in Scheme, and
created a converter library &amp; program that takes the DSL as input
and outputs <code>.gv</code> text. It almost certainly doesn’t support
all of the features of DOT, but I intentionally left out “validation” of
input, because I don’t know all of DOT and I don’t pretend to. The DSL
is not only a Scheme representation but also saves some work.</p>
<p>I use it on this site, e.g. on <a
href="/algebra/cat_theory_perf.html">/algebra/cat_theory_perf.md</a>.</p>
<p>The code can be found on https://github.com/siiky/gvs but try not to
read it, it’s much too ugly. :/</p>
