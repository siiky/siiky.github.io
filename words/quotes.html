<p>The subtitle’s translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listen. So you think you’d just be a shepherd’s dog. What’s wrong with that? A good dog can lead the sheep to greener pastures and earn their gratitude.</p>

<p>This one is somewhat longer, and it’s not someone’s or some character’s quote, but it’s a good paragraph from a good book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><q>A New Theory of Biology</q> was the title of the paper which Mustapha Mond had just finished reading. He sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page. <q>The author’s mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. <em>Not to be published</em>.</q> He underlined the words. <q>The author will be kept under supervision. His transference to the Marine Biological Station of St Helena may become necessary.</q> A pity, he thought, as he signed his name. It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose – well, you didn’t know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily recondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes – make them lose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside of the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the present circumstances, admissible. He picked up his pen again, and under the words <em><q>Not to be published</q></em> drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed. <q>What fun it would be,</q> he thought, <q>if one didn’t have to think about happiness!</q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>– From <em>Brave New World</em>, by Aldous Huxley (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_new_world">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<h1 data-number="7" id="section-6"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> </h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but alread it was impossible to say which was which.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– From <em>Animal Farm</em>, by George Orwell</p>
<h1 data-number="8" id="section-7"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> </h1>
<blockquote>
<p>But neither man nor any other animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for that purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– David Hume, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#David_Hume">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</a></p>
<h1 data-number="9" id="section-8"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> </h1>
<blockquote>
<p>6.371: At the basis of the whole modern view of the world lies the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– From <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ludwig-wittgenstein/tractatus-logico-philosophicus/c-k-ogden"><em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em></a>, by Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>
