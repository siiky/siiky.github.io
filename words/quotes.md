My transcription, possibly wrong:

-- 影山、梶に、_人間の條件_ から ([ウィキペディア][human_condition_wp_jp], [IMDb][human_condition_imdb])

The subtitle's translation:

> Listen. So you think you'd just be a shepherd's dog. What's wrong with that?
> A good dog can lead the sheep to greener pastures and earn their gratitude.

-- Kageyama, to Kaji, from _The Human Condition: No Greater Love_
([Wikipedia][human_condition_wp_en], [IMDb][human_condition_imdb])

This one is somewhat longer, and it's not someone's or some character's quote,
but it's a good paragraph from a good book.

> "A New Theory of Biology" was the title of the paper which Mustapha Mond had
> just finished reading. He sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then
> picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page. "The author's mathematical
> treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but
> heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and
> potentially subversive. _Not to be published_." He underlined the words. "The
> author will be kept under supervision. His transference to the Marine
> Biological Station of St Helena may become necessary." A pity, he thought, as
> he signed his name. It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began
> admitting explanations in terms of purpose -- well, you didn't know what the
> result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily recondition the
> more unsettled minds among the higher castes -- make them lose their faith in
> happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal
> was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside of the present human sphere; that the
> purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some
> intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge.
> Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the
> present circumstances, admissible. He picked up his pen again, and under the
> words _"Not to be published"_ drew a second line, thicker and blacker than
> the first; then sighed. "What fun it would be," he thought, "if one didn't
> have to think about happiness!"

-- From _Brave New World_, by Aldous Huxley
([Wikipedia][brave_new_world_huxley_wp])

> The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from
> pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.

-- From _Animal Farm_, by George Orwell

#

> God's power we allow is infinite: But neither man nor any other animal are
> happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He
> is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature
> tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for
> that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no
> inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do
> his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?

-- David Hume, [Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]

#

> 6.371: At the basis of the whole modern view of the world lies the illusion
> that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.

-- From [_Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_], by Ludwig Wittgenstein
