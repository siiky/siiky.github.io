The Celts, mighty warriors, were also an agronomist culture who tossed rice, millet, and other grains to appease spirits and ask for blessing and fertility for the couple. Ancient Romans used wheat. Italians toss candies or sugared nuts. The Polish use rice but also place coins at the couple&#39;s feet to ensure prosperity. In Morocco, it&#39;s dried dates or figs and Eastern India&#39;s tradition is a rain of flower petals. </blockquote><p>The rest of the page is a bit of bull so you can ignore it...
