I heard about zettelkasten I don&#39;t even remember whence anymore, but it stuck with me. I spent a couple of weeks learning more about it, searching for (software) systems, &amp;c, until I finally settled on Org Roam. As a Vim user this was a very... interesting experience! But let&#39;s leave that for another day.</p><ul><li><a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/blog.schmidhuberj.de/2022/08/07/when-does-a-zettelkasten-become-useful">When does a Zettelkasten become useful?</a></li></ul><blockquote>Here, my notes are basically a structure-note for every big topic linking to structure-notes of every sub-topic linking to the actual information that sometimes links back to already learned information, but not from other subjects. The problem here is, that this is easily converted to a linear note structure, (...)<br></br>(...)<br></br>To basically summarize what I (believe) am doing differently in my Zettelkasten, I emphasize on collecting the information in a way I understand and is easy to search instead of linking the notes to create new ideas. Maybe the word &quot;wiki&quot; might be closer to what I am doing, but as I was starting off with the idea of creating a Zettelkasten, this word has stuck for now.</blockquote><p>After reading both posts, I guess what I&#39;m doing is more like a wiki too. I have a page/file for a topic usually, where I write about it and how it relates to other topics. I tried opening some random notes just now (in Doom: SPC n r a) and like 5 in a row were pretty much useless. Some of these were created during the first few days, when I was kind of filling it up with whatever came to mind, kind of trying things out. Reflecting on how I use it too (more next) in retrospect it makes sense now that opening random notes doesn&#39;t prove too informative or interesting.</p><ul><li><a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/rawtext.club/~mieum/relog/2022-08-08-zettelkasten_utility.gmi">Zettelkasten Utility</a></li></ul><blockquote>So much thought and energy went into organizing and maintaining a sensible structure that it became kind of unwieldy and was ultimately not very flexible.</blockquote><p>I sometimes feel this too, especially for larger pages it can become a yak shaving activity -- &quot;would it be better if I laid things out this way or that way?&quot; And whichever way I choose I lose, it&#39;s never the right one, because every time I come back to the page I get that same feeling, that maybe it&#39;s still not just right...</p><blockquote>It seems to me that one reason people will tend to impose structure in a zettelkasten-like system is that they are digesting information that is already structured. It seems like it would make sense to replicate that structure---that it would be useful---especially, as Schmiddi suggests, if the point of the lecture you are attending is for students to replicate its contents.</blockquote><p>Some of my most comprehensive and useful files are on Petri nets, and they exactly fit the description of this paragraph. I wrote these notes while reading the papers. Sometimes I would pause reading to take note or transcribe something directly on the computer, other times I would take note somewhere (a notebook or the paper itself) and later transcribe to the appropriate file. In general, the material wasn&#39;t adapted very much from the original text.</p><p>mieum clearly knows their zettelkasten shit better than I do. After reading their post it became apparent to me that my &quot;zettelkasten&quot; isn&#39;t that great quality. Even so! Not all is lost! I&#39;m using Org mode after all. This took me a long while to get familiar with but damn, all the praise people throw at it is well deserved.</p><p>I use it for pretty much everything I want to document for myself now. Pages I want to read/write about, books/videos/movies/series I want to read/watch, events with notes available right there, &amp;c, &amp;c. Everything that isn&#39;t in this capsule, or paper notebooks that I&#39;ll never pick up again, is in there. I have a significant collection of Org Roam files now. When I want to search for something I can, and I usually find what I&#39;m looking for. Things are tagged liberally (I had this insight early on luckily). I have URLs to external sources, associated files (PDFs, images, audio files, &amp;c), my own notes, quotes, code sometimes, ... Everything!</p><p>I may be a hoarder, but I think this is great! It&#39;s a lot better than my previous approach of writing random things in whichever random paper notebook is closest (I have 4 or 5 of these spread all over the place) and never getting around to re-read and transcribe it into some more organized notes system.</p><p>(BTW I have 714 files as of now, the first created on 2021/08/28 22:42:02 and the latest on 2022/08/09 17:13:50 according to their filenames)</p><blockquote>The other reason I find is that people don&#39;t fully trust their tools, or their tools are cumbersome enough to inhibit a freer interaction with the zettelkasten, so it feels like structure is necessary to access or retrieve all the information it contains.</blockquote><p>This is an interesting thought. Yeah, it may be that I don&#39;t trust the zettelkasten system and that leads me to try and organize monolithic notes from the start. But if that&#39;s the case (me not trusting it) I think it&#39;s more likely because I haven&#39;t used it correctly, rather than because I don&#39;t believe it works. I&#39;ve thought about this in the past, even before and after settling on Org Roam: maybe I&#39;m losing something for trying to use the zettelkasten system in a computer. It&#39;s so easy to put anything in (SPC n r f); I&#39;m not forced to think about what I&#39;m putting in; and I can always edit it later!</p><p>I wonder if I should start one with pen&amp;paper.</p><ul><li><a href="../petri_nets/logs.html">Petri Nets Logs</a></li></ul></body></html>
