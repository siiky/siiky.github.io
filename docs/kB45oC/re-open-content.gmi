=> gemini://gemini.bunburya.eu/gemlog/posts/2022-08-22-open-content.gmi @bunburya shared several open crowdsourcing projects.

I didn't know some of them, while others I knew only the name. Here I'd like to add that OpenFoodFacts has a couple of sister projects:

=> https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org Open Pet Food Facts
=> https://world.openbeautyfacts.org Open Beauty Facts

And would also like to mention iNaturalist, where people can contribute observations of animals, plants, fungi, &c. Photos  are shared under user-chosen terms, but they recommend using some CC licenses compatible with Wikimedia Commons.

=> https://www.inaturalist.org iNaturalist
=> https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/developers Datasets (end of the page)
=> https://commons.wikimedia.org Wikimedia Commons

I can't find now the "official documentation" regarding the recommended license but I found these related pages instead:
