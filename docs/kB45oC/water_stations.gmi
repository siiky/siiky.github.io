Crazy idea: what if instead of selling plastic bottles, stores sold water by the litre, similarly to how diesel/gasoline is sold by the litre? People would BYOB, be it plastic, metal, or glass, and fill it up.

I know some places already do this, or have something similar, but it's not that widespread.
