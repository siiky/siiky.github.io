Almost rude.</p><p>After a flat out &quot;No&quot;, he said something along the lines of:</p><blockquote>This is not a school, it&#39;s a bookbinding shop, I can&#39;t teach you. If I spend my time teaching just about anybody who comes around with interest I won&#39;t have the time to do what my customers ask me, and then where does the money come from?</blockquote><p>I mean, sure, but, I didn&#39;t expect anyone to be teaching me anything full-time, I have shit to do too!</p><p>At the end he asked me why I wanted to learn about it, what kinds of books I read and am interested in, what I do &quot;for a living&quot;, how I found them, ... Very weird, almost as if testing me or something. And would you ever believe me if I told you he started pulling out his massive book knowledge phallus? At least I got some new contacts and places to check out.</p><p>It was very disheartening TBH...</p></body></html>
