<h1>No bookbinding for you</h1>

<p>I went to a bookbinding shop today asking if they would teach me some of their craft but the owner, an old guy, was so harsh... Almost rude.</p>
<p>After a flat out &quot;No&quot;, he said something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not a school, it's a bookbinding shop, I can't teach you. If I spend my time teaching just about anybody who comes around with interest I won't have the time to do what my customers ask me, and then where does the money come from?</p></blockquote>
<p>I mean, sure, but, I didn't expect anyone to be teaching me anything full-time, I have shit to do too!</p>
<p>At the end he asked me why I wanted to learn about it, what kinds of books I read and am interested in, what I do &quot;for a living&quot;, how I found them, ... Very weird, almost as if testing me or something. And would you ever believe me if I told you he started pulling out his massive book knowledge phallus? At least I got some new contacts and places to check out.</p>
<p>It was very disheartening TBH...</p>
