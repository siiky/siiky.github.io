I&#39;m like a squirrel chasing new nuts every 5 seconds, almost as if the nuts I catch rot by the touch. It&#39;s completely irrational to take on so many things simultaneously, and yet, here we are. I have more than 4 ongoing books for some reason. I haven&#39;t read a single word of any of them for the past... 2 weeks? Maybe more?

I have literally hundreds of tabs open on Firefox of things that I at some point wanted to read but didn&#39;t have the time at the time. To put it in scale: I use one of those sidetabs plugins; the scrollbar is about the size of a tab; one screenful of tabs is 29 tabs; so I have roughly 29Â²=841 open tabs.</p><ul><li><a href="zettelkasten_utility.html">As I&#39;ve said before, I may be a hoarder...</a></li></ul><p>(BTW ew0k, in case you read this, some of the links in those pages seem to be broken)</p></body></html>
