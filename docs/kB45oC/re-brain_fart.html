<p>I just read these posts by ew0k and really they hit the spot... Added to the reclog of today.</p>

<p>It's just that I have all these ideas that I'd like to deliver on.</p>
<p>But at the same time I have neither the time nor the energy to take any of them on, frankly.</p>
<p>You'd think I'd learned by now, but no.</p>
<p>Stuck in a loop, having a hard time breaking out.</p>
<p>There's never time. Maybe you feel like you'll have time, so you start something today. It'll just be a few hours this week and then it's done.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could quote almost the whole thing verbatim in here and just say &quot;this ^&quot;.</p>
<p>I can relate 100% with them. I'm like a squirrel chasing new nuts every 5 seconds, almost as if the nuts I catch rot by the touch. It's completely irrational to take on so many things simultaneously, and yet, here we are. I have more than 4 ongoing books for some reason. I haven't read a single word of any of them for the past... 2 weeks? Maybe more? Shiet...</p>

<p>I'm honestly surprised I've been able to keep at it on the Petri nets. Fingers crossed it continues that way because I think they'll be key to getting some new doors open.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="petri_nets/logs.html">Petri nets logs</a></li></ul>
<p>And the cherry on top: all the while I feel bad for putting other things to the side (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>OSM editing</li>
<li>ARM64 Salmonella machine for CHICKEN</li>
<li>alist-let</li>
<li>save-for-later (a project I really would like to get done but feels daunting)</li>
<li>Books I still haven't finished</li>
<li>Books I still haven't started</li>
<li>Learning some basic survival skills</li>
<li>Topics I still haven't read about</li>
<li>(Natural) languages: haven't practiced my Japanese in a long while and I've stopped the Language Transfer Greek course at least 3 times now</li>
<li>(Programming) languages: Erlang, Elixir, Rust, Go, Common Lisp, Idris, FORTH, ...</li></ul>
<p>The list could go on and on for a really long time. I have literally hundreds of tabs open on Firefox of things that I at some point wanted to read but didn't have the time at the time. To put it in scale: I use one of those sidetabs plugins; the scrollbar is about the size of a tab; one screenful of tabs is 29 tabs; so I have roughly 29Â²=841 open tabs.</p>
