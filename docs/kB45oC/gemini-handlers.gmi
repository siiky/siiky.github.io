# Custom Gemini Handlers

Just learned how to setup custom handlers for the gemini scheme in Firefox and XDG.

For Firefox, go to about:config, create a new boolean variable named network.protocol-handler.expose.gemini and set it to false. Open a gemini URL, choose your Gemini client and you're good to go.

For XDG, create a desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications/ (or your equivalent) with the following content, replacing Lagrange with your client of choice:

```lagrange.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Lagrange Gemini Client
Exec=lagrange %u
StartupNotify=false
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/gemini;
```

And you're good to go, opening gemini URLs with xdg-open or clicking things should work now. It seemed to take effect immediately here.
