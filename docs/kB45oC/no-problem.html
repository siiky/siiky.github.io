Arkeo is.</blockquote><blockquote>Arkeo works by incentivizing independent node operators to run arbitrary nodes on whatever chains they wish. Someone could run a Bitcoin node only, or a suite of nodes across multiple chains.</blockquote><blockquote>Services that consume node data pay for that data (@infura_io is great... but they can censor you: they&#39;re centralized).<br></br><br></br>With Arkeo, all such services now have a permissionless alternative.</blockquote><blockquote>The entire project has been DAO organized and funded. <br></br><br></br>No VCs own it<br></br>No corporate entities control it<br></br>It ain&#39;t &quot;based&quot; anywhere<br></br><br></br>The revolution will not be centralized.
