<blockquote>
<p>Behind the scenes, ShapeShift DAO has been building something called Arkeo.</p>
<p>It's a decentralized backend for nodes.</p>
<p>If you've ever thought, &quot;sucks that everyone uses centralized node infrastructure like Infura...&quot; then you'll understand what Arkeo is solving.</p>
<p>ShapeShift decided to build this because it ran into this very problem: how can we be a <em>truly</em> decentralized app when we're calling blockchain data from centralized node companies?</p>
<p>If your node provider can shut off your access, it ain't permissionless. Arkeo is.</p>
<p>Arkeo works by incentivizing independent node operators to run arbitrary nodes on whatever chains they wish. Someone could run a Bitcoin node only, or a suite of nodes across multiple chains.</p>
<p>Services that consume node data pay for that data (@infura_io is great... but they can censor you: they're centralized).</p>
<p>With Arkeo, all such services now have a permissionless alternative.</p>
<p>The entire project has been DAO organized and funded.</p>
<p>No VCs own it
No corporate entities control it
It ain't &quot;based&quot; anywhere</p>
<p>The revolution will not be centralized. Enjoy!</p></blockquote>

<p>Gee, wouldn't it be fuckin' A if we didn't need to trust any one single entity to interact with a distributed network?!</p>
