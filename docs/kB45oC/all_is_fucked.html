Can you think of anything that&#39;s more boring than this? I&#39;m going through past exams to prepare (because we rarely did any such exercises during classes; grading is mostly based on a PA) and I&#39;m wondering if it makes any difference. The (theory) lectures were so damn boring and uninteresting I couldn&#39;t bear to be there, I couldn&#39;t concentrate on what the professor said, I couldn&#39;t not think to myself &quot;what a bunch of bull!&quot; So instead I stopped attending, naturally.</p><p>The exam I&#39;m going through is mostly T/F. Example questions:</p><ul><li>The Observer pattern statically specifies the observer objects.</li><li>An architectural pattern improves the coherency of the modules of a system.</li><li>In a risk oriented approach, risk is defined as the probability of failure divided by the impact of that failure.</li></ul><p>Just lol... I tried reading the slides the prof used in the lectures before this but jesus, could they have been less interesting? If I did the exam, studied, and re-did the exam, I wonder if my grade would at all improve.</p><p>So here I am being more productive instead.</p><p>University is sucking ass because, even though I&#39;m now on my master&#39;s, I&#39;m stuck with shit courses I couldn&#39;t care less about -- another one is &quot;Applications and Computation Services in the Cloud&quot;... what the fuck is this? Getting Employed at Scale? Corporate Programming 101? StackOverflow for Dummies? I can&#39;t wait for the second semester to finally have the classes I&#39;m interested in again, those that I picked, why I applied to the damn degree...</p><p>And I started thinking about the tuition money. Not a trivial amount. Still, almost only half of what I used to pay while on my bachelor&#39;s, that&#39;s good! But then... wait a second. I pay monthly (we pay, it&#39;s a shared expense) 82.496% of the YEARLY University tuition in rent! I&#39;m fucked! We&#39;re fucked! All&#39;s fucked!</p></body></html>
