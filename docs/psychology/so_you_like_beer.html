This is the first time it happened to me I think.</p><p>I was in an open space, at night, palm trees around and many lights, some kind of event, many people were around, almost like a festival or something of the sort. The place was somewhere in Asia (not because there were specific features I can point out to, but because it was a dream, I just know alright?). A guy crossed paths with me and asked if I didn&#39;t like beer, or why I wasn&#39;t drinking beer, or something like that. I replied that I don&#39;t much appreciate beer. He gave me a dark, almost black, beer bottle, the label was black, and it was in Thai or similar (so I assume I was in Thailand). I gave it a sip and indeed not that bad, nothing like the crap I tasted in real life...</p><p>That was the other day. Today I was again at that same place, again at night, decoration was much the same -- palm trees and lights, very tropical-like -- and a multitude of people too. And I happened to cross that guy again. But this time I had one of those beer bottles in hand and he just rhetorically asked &quot;so you do like beer after all?&quot;</p><p>And then the dream quickly de-railed into weird shit: pepper shakers have wholes not only at the top but also on the sides of the metal head so that mosquitoes can get inside, while salt shakers don&#39;t so mosquitoes don&#39;t get inside those. Why that would be relevant or interesting I couldn&#39;t possibly know.</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_and_pepper_shakers">Salt and pepper shakers</a></li></ul><p>Curious question: while reading the above, what ethnicity did you mentally assign to The Guy?</p></body></html>
