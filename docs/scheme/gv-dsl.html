<h1>GraphViz Scheme DSL</h1>

<p>I've (loosely) defined a DSL to represent GraphViz DOT in Scheme, and created a converter library &amp; program that takes the DSL as input and outputs .gv text. It almost certainly doesn't support all of the features of DOT, but I intentionally left out &quot;validation&quot; of input, because I don't know all of DOT and I don't pretend to. The DSL is not only a Scheme representation but also saves some work.</p>
<p>I use it on this site, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../algebra/cat_theory_perf.html">Category Theory and Performance</a></li></ul>
<p>The code can be found online, but try not to read it, it's much too ugly. :/</p>
