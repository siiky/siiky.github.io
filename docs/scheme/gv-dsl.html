It almost certainly doesn&#39;t support all of the features of DOT, but I intentionally left out &quot;validation&quot; of input, because I don&#39;t know all of DOT and I don&#39;t pretend to. The DSL is not only a Scheme representation but also saves some work.</p><p>I use it on this site, for example:</p><ul><li><a href="../algebra/cat_theory_perf.html">Category Theory and Performance</a></li></ul><p>The code can be found online, but try not to read it, it&#39;s much too ugly. :/</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/siiky/gvs">https://github.com/siiky/gvs</a></li></ul></body></html>
