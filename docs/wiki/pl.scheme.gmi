## My projects

### ipfs

A Kubo RPC client library. Made a Lua port as well.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/ipfs.scm
=> https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/ipfs
=> ../projects/ipfs.gmi
=> pl.lua.gmi

### gmi

A Gemtext reader/writer. Made a Lua port as well.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/gmi.scm
=> https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/gmi
=> ../projects/gemtext.gmi
=> pl.lua.gmi

### transmission

A Transmission RPC client.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/transmission.scm
=> https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/transmission

### daemon

A convenience procedure to run some Scheme code in a process in the background -- or not!

=> https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/daemon
=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/daemon

### alist-let

A macro similar to let that can be used to destructure alists. In experimental stage still. First iteration ever was from the transmission egg.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/alist-let

### ttltbl

A TTL table/dictionary -- i.e. a cache.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/ttltbl.scm

### gminid

My fork of Kooda's geminid, and a Gemini IPFS gateway.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/geminid
=> ../projects/gemini-ipfs-gateway.gmi Gemini IPFS gateway

### trmote

A few utility programs based on the transmission egg to help manage a Transmission instance -- especially transmission-update-seed-priority and transmission-verify!

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/trmote

### cling

This is a Command Line INterface Generator. I like the idea and the functionality I managed to program in, and kinda like the usability, but I don't like at all how it's implemented. It's ugly af, and that's the only reason I haven't published it as an egg yet.

Used by trmote and a few of my other unpublished eggs.

### invidious

Invidious API client.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/invidious.scm

### ivp

Search and play videos and playlists from Invidious without leaving your terminal! Based on invidious and cling.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/ivp

### gvs

GraphViz Extension Language for Scheme.

=> https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/gvs
