While I don&#39;t have any major issues with it, only minor annoyances, there&#39;s A LOT of stuff in there that I wouldn&#39;t mind making public, such as notes or comments on things I read, listen to, watch, ideas, &amp;c. It could be useful even to me, e.g. if I want to reference something I&#39;ve written but don&#39;t have access to one of my PCs at the moment. The problem is that there&#39;s no good way of making them public that I know of (simplistically, on the Geminispace).</p><p>And so this idea was born. I&#39;m gonna play with this read-only (to you but not to me :) &quot;wiki&quot;-like thing, see where it goes. Since FOSDEM 2023 is right this weekend, I&#39;ll probably start with that as a pilot. Let&#39;s see how it goes! As for a plan/ideas, what I&#39;m thinking of doing, take a look at the Plan/Ideas page:</p><ul><li><a href="wiki_plan.html">Plan/Ideas</a></li></ul><p>The best way to explore it through Gemini, since there&#39;s no way to search it (maybe using one of the search engines?), is to browse the lists. There are lists of all pages sorted by a few different criteria; and there are lists of the pages of a certain tag sorted by last update.</p><ul><li><a href="by/index.html">Lists</a></li><li><a href="tag/index.html">Tags</a></li></ul><p>To learn more about the behind the scenes of this wiki, take a look at the Meta page; to learn more about me, my capsule, and lawerstuffs, take a look at the About page; and to get in touch with me, take a look at the Contact page.</p><ul><li><a href="meta.html">Meta</a></li><li><a href="../about.html">About</a></li><li><a href="../contact.html">Contact</a></li></ul></body></html>
