Small-ish ~80 page booklet about the fauna, flora, and more of the Trás-os-Montes. I didn't even know, before reading this, that we had so many "exotic" animals. How... weird! I must get out more. What surprised me especially was the several birds of prey. I always thought these were things  of other countries.
