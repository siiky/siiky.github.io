Started learning Go at work. A coleague suggested following "Go By Example" and taking a look at "Go Traps".

In "Go By Example" they suggest these additional pages to learn about some specific aspects of the language.

There's an example of WaitGroups. At first I thought "nice, structured concurrency!" But then, the interface is kinda funky. And there doesn't seem be any way to kill processes/threads/goroutines/green-threads/w.e. you wanna call'em.
