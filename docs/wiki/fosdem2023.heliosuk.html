<p>IPC is with a synchronous (blocking) message-passing style.</p>
<p>At the end, during QA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>correcting a mistake Plan9 made, which is that, Plan9 was correct that distributed computing is the future, but it was incorrect that they would be distributed across a mainframe and a bunch of thin clients in an office building, which is how Plan9 was designed. In fact, the group of devices that should be running a uniform Operating System is all of your personal devices -- my laptop, my workstation at home, my phones -- they should all present as a single system. And so, it's very vague and floffy and long-term vision, but I would like to try to achieve that with the design of Gaia and Ares.</p></blockquote>
