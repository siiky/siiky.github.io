In fact, the group of devices that should be running a uniform Operating System is all of your personal devices -- my laptop, my workstation at home, my phones -- they should all present as a single system. And so, it&#39;s very vague and floffy and long-term vision, but I would like to try to achieve that with the design of Gaia and Ares.</blockquote><p>There was a shorter presentation talk.</p><ul><li><a href="fosdem2023.helios.html">fosdem2023.helios.gmi</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="fosdem2023.html">fosdem2023.gmi</a></li><li><a href="20230205.html">20230205.gmi</a></li></ul></body></html>
