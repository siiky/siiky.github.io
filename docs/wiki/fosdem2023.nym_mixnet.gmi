Talk about the Nym Mixnet, a "decentralized incentivised mixnet + private credential".

* Overlay network (like I2P)
* Onion routing (like I2P)
* Based on the Loopix design
* Sphinx packets
* Packet re-ordering and timing obfuscation
* Cover traffic
* Single Use Reply Blocks (SURB)

* Network directory -- set of validators running a consensus protocol (apparently a blockchain?); keeps track of all mixnodes and gateways
* Mixnodes are rewarding with NYMs for mixing network traffic
* NYMs can be used to acquire bandwidth credentials (coconut credentials)

"Coconut credentials" break linkability betwen identity and the right to use a service

Currently at around 500 mixnodes
