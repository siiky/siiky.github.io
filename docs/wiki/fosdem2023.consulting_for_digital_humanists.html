<p>Her site seems to be down?</p>
<p>Lightning talk about her experience working as a programmer for humanities acadamics researchers.</p>
<p>I found this bit funny:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been asked in conferences to give PowerPoint (pptx) files, and Word documents, and no one gets offended by that.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to her, there's this general difference between programmers and humanists.</p>
<p>Programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mostly male</li>
<li>Programmer-like programs and tools -- Linux/Max, LaTeX, terminals, ...</li>
<li>Influenced by the industry (in terms of jobs) -- salary, practices, ...</li>
<li>Broad (commercial) topics</li>
<li>Metrics oriented -- quantified performance, speed, memory, ...</li></ul>
<p>Humanists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Female/mixed audience</li>
<li>Point-and-click programs and tools, and often proprietary -- Windows/Mac, PowerPoint, Word, ...</li>
<li>Academic job culture</li>
<li>Scarce data, niche topics</li>
<li>Question oriented</li></ul>
<p>Asking the right question as engineer, when analyzing a possible project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Context: what is you domain? what does this domain focus on?</p></li>
<li>
<p>What is the problem you try to solve?</p></li>
<li>
<p>(Eventually) what did you already try to solve syour problem? What tools did you use?</p></li>
<li>
<p>What are the data you have (or hope to collect)?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Can you present me your data? Size, format, how has it been collected?</p></li>
