* I2P is strictly a transport layer overlay network
* D-BFT (Democratic Byzantine Fault-Tolerance)
* Vincent Gramoli, "Blockchain Scalability and its Foundations in Distributed Systems" (ISBN 978-3-031-12578-2)
* Majority determines the truth, so if >50% of the nodes believe that name XYZ corresponds to the address ADDR, then XYZ is ADDR.
