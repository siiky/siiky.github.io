Instead, electrons &quot;exist&quot;, move, zip here and there, within a certain space around the nucleus. The space around the nucleus an electron spends most of its time in (e.g. 90% of the time) is called an &quot;orbital&quot; (NOT an &quot;orbit&quot;).</p><p>Additionally, an atom&#39;s electrons don&#39;t all necessarily fit in the same orbital. Because of this, they&#39;re arranged in/distributed across shells (sort of like &quot;levels&quot;; see pic), called 1n, 2n, 3n, &amp;c. Shells are generally filled with electrons from the lower to higher levels: first 1n, then 2n, then 3n, &amp;c (there are exceptions, apparently?).</p><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/87d06355e2e7f473352aab198549a97816c3011a.png" alt="Atom shells (&quot;levels&quot;)"></img><p>In turn, each shell is composed of one or more subshells (see pic):</p><ul><li>1n is composed of 1s</li><li>2n is composed of 2s and 2p</li><li>&amp;c (i.e. I don&#39;t know more)</li></ul><p>And subshells are composed of one or more orbitals (see pic):</p><ul><li>s subshells (1s, 2s, 3s, &amp;c) are composed of a single orbital</li><li>p subshells (2p, 3p, &amp;c) are composed of 3 orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz, &amp;c)</li><li>d subshells are composed of 5 orbitals</li><li>f subshells are composed of 7 orbitals</li></ul><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/1a86b516c8ecf29a7d1f2f17b4f54eb8bb7c72c2.png" alt="Atom shells &amp; subshells"></img><p>Finally, each orbital may have at most 2 electrons, not more.</p><p>s orbitals have a spherical shape; and p orbitals have a dumbbell (or &quot;hourglass&quot;) shape; (don&#39;t know about the other two).</p></body></html>
