Talk about hole punching, with a short explanation of libp2p's implementation, and an experiment they ran at Protocol Labs during 2022/12. It's pretty simple actually: two peers initially use a middleman to communicate (relay), establish a connection through this relay, and measure their RTT; to hole punch a connection, A tells B to do a hole punch and waits RTT/2, when B gets that packet, sends a connect to A, and both packets reach their destinations around (more or less) the same time.
