However, even if there was, time doesn&#39;t imply causality -- e.g., just because event E1 happened before event E2, doesn&#39;t mean E2 was in any way affected by E1.</p><p>Additionally, because the &quot;real&quot; physical time is only an illusion (see special theory of relativity), even assuming a global clock, an event E1 that seems to node N1 to have happened before another event E2, may seem to node N2 to have happened after event E2.</p></body></html>
