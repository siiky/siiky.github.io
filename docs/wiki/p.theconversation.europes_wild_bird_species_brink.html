Globally, the number of species is 10.6% higher within protected areas compared with unprotected areas.</blockquote><blockquote>In 2018, EU member states banned the use of certain neonicotinoids (a class of insecticide) after mounting evidence of their widespread impact on insects – an important source of food for birds.<br></br><br></br>(...)
