> Currently, 18% of the EU’s land surface area is designated as a Natura 2000 site, and the aim is to create a network of connected protected sites right across the continent. 
>
> Evidence on the effectiveness of protected areas is clear: when implemented appropriately, they work. Globally, the number of species is 10.6% higher within protected areas compared with unprotected areas.

> In 2018, EU member states banned the use of certain neonicotinoids (a class of insecticide) after mounting evidence of their widespread impact on insects – an important source of food for birds.
>
> (...) Unfortunately, the UK government has authorised the emergency application of neonicotinoids in each of the past three years.
