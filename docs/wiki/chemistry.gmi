Molecule with the same chemical formula (e.g. C4H10) but with different bonding, shape, or orientation. Isomers may have different chemical properties -- even though they're made out of the same atoms!

> In the context of large biological molecules such as DNA, proteins, and carbohydrates, structural differences in the carbon skeleton often affect how the molecule functions.

> The difference between a pair of enantiomers may seem very small. In some cases, though, two enantiomers may have very different biological effects. For example, the D form of the drug ethambutol is used to treat tuberculosis, while the L form actually causes blindness!
