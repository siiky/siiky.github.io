As the water in your solution evaporates, the sugar solution becomes more concentrated. At some point, there will not be enough water to dissolve all the sugar, and thatâ€™s when the crystals start to form.<br></br><br></br>The slower the water evaporates, the larger the crystals will grow. Big crystals might take several days to grow. If you are impatient and keep your water in a warm place, the water will evaporate more quickly, but the crystals will end up smaller.</blockquote></body></html>
