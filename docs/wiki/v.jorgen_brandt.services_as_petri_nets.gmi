Talk by the author of gen_pnet, a Petri nets implementation in Erlang, about Petri nets and why they're superior to state machines.

When I first found the library it looked like a waste of Erlang: why not take advantage of Erlang's processes and everything everywhere all at once? After watching the talk I understand now that that was not its purpose, and it makes sense. The purpose of the lib is to model one (Erlang) process as a Petri net, and for that it looks actually pretty good.
