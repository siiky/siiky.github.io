If processing can be made more accessible to anyone with a moderate computer, the data is easier to use for everyone. It would open a lot of possibilities for developers, researchers, &amp;c.</p><p>On top of that, these performance improvements would mean energy savings as well -- a plus for everyone.</p></body></html>
