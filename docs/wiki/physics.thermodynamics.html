This is also called thermal energy -- the greater the thermal energy, the greater the kinetic energy of atomic mothin, and vice versa. The average thermal energy of a group of molecules is what we call temperature, and when thermal energy is being transfered between two objects, it&#39;s known as heat.</blockquote></body></html>
