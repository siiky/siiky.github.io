Fatty acids that contain cis double bonds are typically oils at room temperature. This is because the bends in the backbone caused by cis double bonds prevent the fatty acids from packing tightly together. In contrast, fatty acids with trans double bonds (popularly called trans fats), are relatively linear, so they can pack tightly together at room temperature and form solid fats.<br></br><br></br>Trans fats are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, so many food manufacturers have eliminated their use in recent years. Fats with trans double bonds are found in some types of shortening and margarine, while fats with cis double bonds may be found in oils, such as olive oil and canola oil. See the article on lipids to learn more about the different types of fats.</blockquote><ul><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/cd652e01368ddc7602dfb35da5b492bed9588556.png" alt="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/cd652e01368ddc7602dfb35da5b492bed9588556.png"></img><li><a href="chemistry.html">§ Hydrocarbons naming and Isomers</a></li></ul><h2>Sugars (carbohydrate)</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/v/molecular-structure-of-glucose">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/v/molecular-structure-of-glucose</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/v/dehydration-synthesis-or-a-condensation-reaction">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/v/dehydration-synthesis-or-a-condensation-reaction</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/v/hydrolysis">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/v/hydrolysis</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/v/molecular-structure-of-fructose">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/v/molecular-structure-of-fructose</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/a/carbohydrates">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/carbohydrates-and-sugars/a/carbohydrates</a></li><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/a9abc037227995fd312a081b39e764032675a71a.png" alt="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/a9abc037227995fd312a081b39e764032675a71a.png"></img></ul><p>Glucose, Galactose, and Fructose are C6H12O6 isomers!</p><ul><li><a href="chemistry.html">chemistry.html</a></li><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/20ed343699a3eaefcf57323286d5f37fa695d448.png" alt="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/20ed343699a3eaefcf57323286d5f37fa695d448.png"></img><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose</a></li></ul><p>Sucrose (&quot;table sugar&quot;) is a disaccharide made of one glucose and one fructose monomer.

Because it&#39;s the inverse process, it uses up one H2O molecule.</p><p>A very interesting thing is that cellulose -- the composition of paper, wood, &amp;c -- is also a polysaccharide! It&#39;s actually a long unbranched chain of glucose. These long chains can bundle up together, in a parallel fashion, through hydrogen bonding, and thereby resulting in the solidity of wood and other plant tissues. Even though cellulose is basically just glucose, humans can&#39;t digest it because they&#39;re of the β variety. This doesn&#39;t make cellulose bad for us, we just don&#39;t digest it.</p><p>Another important polysaccharide is chitin, the main constituent of the exoskeleton of arthropods (e.g. insects, arachnids, crustaceans).</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod</a></li></ul></body></html>
