This fact is what makes water molecules &quot;glue&quot; together to form a liquid: Oxygen atoms of one water molecule attract slightly to Hydrogen atoms of other water molecules (and vice versa), making a set of water molecules appear to aggregate as a single &quot;object&quot;.</p><p>Water has a lower density in the solid state than in the liquid state. This property is in part helpful to life. As an example: imagine a pond, and very cold temperatures; if water was more dense as a solid than as a liquid, once the surface of the pond froze it would sink to the bottom; and then a new surface; and then another; until there was no liquid water left. However, because water is less dense as a solid, the frozen surface stays on top of the liquid water.</p><p>Another important property is its high heat capacity, i.e., it takes a lot of energy to heat up a certain amount of water. Because of this, the temperature of a certain body of water doesn&#39;t fluctuate much, even if &quot;outside&quot; the temperature fluctuates wildly.</p><h2>Atoms</h2><ul><li><a href="chemistry.atoms.html">chemistry.atoms.html</a></li></ul><blockquote>Most of organic chemistry—the chemistry of carbon-containing compounds, which are central to biology—involves interactions between electrons in s and p subshells, so these are the most important subshell types to be familiar with.</blockquote></body></html>
