I strongly recommend you go check them out. cosmopolitan is the libc APE is based on (and redbean is based on APE btw). redbean is a Lua batteries included HTTP server. There&#39;s also fullmoon which is a more-batteries-included HTTP server framework based on redbean.</p><ul><li><a href="pl.lua.html">pl.lua.gmi</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/pkulchenko/fullmoon">https://github.com/pkulchenko/fullmoon</a></li></ul><blockquote>Losers always whine about how their bloat is a calculated tradeoff. The important thing to consider is that there is no tradeoff. Just engineers who&#39;ve been victimized by the accidental complexity of modern software, chose to stop caring, and yearn for another break while their code compiles-like Dennis from Jurassic Park.</blockquote><p>The easiest tricks (that even I can understand) are</p><ul><li>field arrangement (i.e. struct packing)</li><li>run length encoding (RLE)</li></ul><p>The first I was already familiar with from the days I shallowly studied C.
