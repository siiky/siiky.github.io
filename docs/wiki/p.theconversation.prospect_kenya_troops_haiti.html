Yet, pressured by the United States in the 1990s, the country lowered its agricultural tariffs to the bare minimum and, in so doing, destroyed local rice production. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton later apologized for the policy, but its legacy still lasts.<br></br><br></br>Haiti today has to import most of the rice it consumes, largely from the United States. And there isn’t enough of it to go around for all Haitians – the U.N. estimates that nearly half of Haiti’s population of 11.5 million is food-insecure.</blockquote><p>Thanks &#39;merica!</p><blockquote>Indeed, from its very beginning as an independent nation in 1804, Haiti has suffered the consequences of its unique place in history: It was simply too much for white colonial powers to see Haiti thrive as the first Black republic resulting from a successful slave rebellion.<br></br>(...)<br></br>However, any thoughts of atoning for past actions seem far from the minds of those looking on as the chaos in Haiti spirals. Rather, many appear to have the kind of mindset expressed in 1994 by current U.S. President Joe Biden when, as a senator discussing the rationale for various interventions, he noted: “If Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean, or rose 300 feet, it wouldn’t matter a whole lot for our interests.”</blockquote><p>wow</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/sep/24/instagram-posts/video-clips-take-bidens-1994-if-haiti-just-quietly/">https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/sep/24/instagram-posts/video-clips-take-bidens-1994-if-haiti-just-quietly/</a></li></ul><p>Does&#39;t look like the context makes that much of a difference.</p></body></html>
