It&#39;s decentralized, there are PODs (Personal Object Database?), somewhat like Matrix, Mastodon, &amp;c &quot;homes&quot;. Applications can be hosted pretty much anywhere in any way, but the data is always hosted on a user&#39;s POD. Users have to explicitly allow the application to access their documents (&quot;files&quot;).</p><p>Data on Solid is saved as &quot;documents&quot;, which are sort of like files but with some metadata attached so that different applications may understand each other. Imagine an application to keep track of the movies/series a user has/wants to watch; the &quot;database&quot; may publish the movies/series data in a format understandable by other applications, such that, for example, you can have a movie/series review site (application) that uses that same movie/series data.</p><p>The speaker is in favor of offline-first applications (yay) and uses CRDTs to resolve conflicts of interleaved updates -- e.g. user updates an item on C1, which is not connected to the internet; afterwards, updates the same item on C2, which is connected to the internet and immediatly syncs with the user&#39;s POD; when C1 goes online, the application resolves whatever conflicts that may arise, with the help of CRDTs, and updates the relevant document(s) on the user&#39;s POD.</p><ul><li><a href="https://forum.solidproject.org/t/authenticating-offline-first-solid-apps/4208">https://forum.solidproject.org/t/authenticating-offline-first-solid-apps/4208</a></li></ul><p>Learned of The Movie DB, which seems to be a crowdsourced alternative to IMDb.
