And because of that, and because of the effort and the time that they put into it, feels like a really big responsibility for outsiders to be able to understand and fully kind of try to comprehend the labor of what that looks like. Because that means that maybe, and this is a big dream, that the more aware we are of the labor behind an incredible project like OSM, the more it can actually be embeded in a real way in anything that uses maps. I think a big problem is public perception of how complicated this process actually is.</blockquote><p>25:23</p></body></html>
