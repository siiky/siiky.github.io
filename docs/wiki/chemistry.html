Isomers may have different chemical properties -- even though they&#39;re made out of the same atoms!</p><blockquote>In the context of large biological molecules such as DNA, proteins, and carbohydrates, structural differences in the carbon skeleton often affect how the molecule functions.</blockquote><blockquote>The difference between a pair of enantiomers may seem very small. In some cases, though, two enantiomers may have very different biological effects. For example, the D form of the drug ethambutol is used to treat tuberculosis, while the L form actually causes blindness!</blockquote><h2>Functional groups</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/properties-of-carbon/hydrocarbon-structures-and-functional-groups/v/functional-groups">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/properties-of-carbon/hydrocarbon-structures-and-functional-groups/v/functional-groups</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/properties-of-carbon/hydrocarbon-structures-and-functional-groups/a/functional-groups">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/properties-of-carbon/hydrocarbon-structures-and-functional-groups/a/functional-groups</a></li></ul></body></html>
