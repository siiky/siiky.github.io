When wishing to write, it has to write to all replicas.</p><p>This is not fault-tolerant: a single replica goes down and clients can no longer write.</p><h3>Quorums</h3><p>Subgroups of the all replicas are used to read and write.</p><p>The simplest approach is read/write to/from a majority of replicas. Depending on problem requirements, however, it may be more beneficial to unbalance the two subsets: in a read-heavy system, clients may read from fewer replicas, as long as they write to more replicas (there&#39;s a rule).</p><p>For this to work, the number of elements of the read/write quorums must meet a couple of requirements (N is number of replicas, Qr/Qw is the read/write quorum):</p><ul><li>#Qr + #Qw &gt; N -- read/write quorums always intersect</li><li>2 * #Qw &gt; N -- any two write quorums always intersect</li></ul><p>But... there&#39;s no definite order in which writes are applied: two given writes X=A and X=B may be applied in different orders in different replicas, so a client may read different values from different read quorums.</p><p>Or... because of network delays, even if operations are delivered and applied in different replicas in the same order, they may be delivered and applied in different times, so a client may read different values from different read quorums.</p><h2>Distributed consensus</h2><p>Algorithms of distributed consensus:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf">(Paxos) Leslie Lamport, &quot;The Part-time Parliament&quot;</a></li><li><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf">(Paxos) Leslie Lamport, &quot;Paxos Made Simple&quot;</a></li><li><a href="raft.html">raft.html</a></li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069">(HotStuff) &quot;HotStuff: BFT Consensus in the Lens of Blockchain&quot;</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="leslie_lamport.html">leslie_lamport.html</a></li></ul><h2>Research</h2><ul><li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1335465">Basic Concepts and Taxonomy of Dependable and Secure Computing</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/MullenderChptr2.pdf">What good are models and what models are good?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2003sp/papers/Gif79.pdf">Weighed voting for replicated data</a></li><li><a href="https://mwhittaker.github.io/publicaations/quoracle.pdf">Read-Write Quorum Systems Made Practical</a></li></ul></body></html>
