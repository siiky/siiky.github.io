The white men promised to respect our sacred places, but of course, there&#39;s a trick. The administration of Aborigine lands is controled by the whites, who obtain the profits from mining. In return, they pay us a kind of pensing. And that, that&#39;s the worst thing. It&#39;s the most efficient way of wiping out our culture. My people don&#39;t realise, but I am old, I know that if a man does not have to work, if he does not grow crops, or hunt or do something, he very quickly destroys himself.</blockquote><p>@ 30m56s</p></body></html>
