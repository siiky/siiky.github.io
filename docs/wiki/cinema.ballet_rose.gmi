A Portuguese mini-series about a scandal around 1967, during Salazar's dictatorship (Estado Novo, or "New State").

The scandal (codenamed "Ballet Rose") was due to highly-ranked individuals (mostly politicians?) getting involved with child prostitution and orgies. I had never heard of this until now, which I guess makes sense, because we learn about the dictatorship (that went between 1933 and 1974) during 7th~8th grade.
