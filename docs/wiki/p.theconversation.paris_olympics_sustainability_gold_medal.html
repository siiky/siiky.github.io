Host cities and organisations typically look to draw attention on the intended positive outcomes, including economic benefits and fan satisfaction. However, the Qatar event was dogged by a wide range of environmental and social controversies. These included the construction of gigantic stadiums in the middle of the desert, the abusive and often deadly working conditions for those constructing the facilities, the air conditioning needed to cool the audience in the country’s extreme temperatures, and the hundreds of international flights taken by more than a million spectators to travel to Qatar.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2022/12/19/world-cup-2022-in-the-end-qatar-wins_6008307_23.html">World Cup 2022: In the end, Qatar wins</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/qatar-world-cup-environmental-climate-change-cost-desert-rcna57632">Qatar World Cup lays bare the huge environmental cost of tournament</a></li></ul><blockquote>Even without the Olympics, Paris holds the title of the most-visited city in the world, bringing with it many sustainability-related challenges.
