Population may be measured in absolute size or in density (size/area). Another important detail is the distribution of the population: uniform, random, or clustered.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-ecology/a/life-tables-survivorship-age-sex-structure">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-ecology/a/life-tables-survivorship-age-sex-structure</a></li></ul><h3>Life tables</h3><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table</a></li></ul><p>Basically a table of survival percentage per age and other factors.</p><h3>Survivorship curves</h3><p>Graphs representing life tables.</p><p>There are three main types of survivorship curves:</p><ul><li>Type I -- organisms don&#39;t usually die young; instead they grow old and die of old age. Humans are an example of this. Type I species usually have few offspring and provide lots of parental care (they have few offspring after all).</li><li>Type II -- organisms have roughly the same chances of dying at any age. Type II species also usually have few offspring, though possibly more than type I, and still give some parental care. Birds are an example of this type.</li><li>Type III -- organisms have a very high chance of NOT surviving young age; but after hitting a certain threshold they have a very high probability of growing old and dying of old age. Species of this type usally have very large numbers of offspring and provide close to no parental care. Examples are trees, fish, amphibians, &amp;c.</li></ul><h3>Population pyramid</h3><p>A survivorship curve of a species by itself is not enough to predict whether a population of that species will grow or shrink. Facts of the different individuals are necessary for that.</p><p>For example, given two populations of bears of the same species and of the same size, if one of them is mostly reproductive-aged individuals, and the other is mostly non-reproductive old-aged individuals -- the former is expected to increase in size, while the latter is expected to decrease in size.</p><p>Also useful to know is the sex distribution of individuals. Both these statistics can be gather in a single population pyramid: an horizontal histogram, where the horizontal axis represents the percentage of individuals of one sex (e.g. male left, female right), and the vertical axis represents the age of a group of individuals of a sex group.</p><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/9a813489ea0a0f80142954f72e387d446caf44c2.png" alt="Population pyramid"></img><br></br><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/f066955c5484153779452015b9cc1b55a479cb72.png" alt="Human population growth"></img><h3>Fecundity</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-ecology/v/organism-life-history-and-fecundity">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-ecology/v/organism-life-history-and-fecundity</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-ecology/a/life-history-strategies">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-ecology/a/life-history-strategies</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecundity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecundity</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semelparity_and_iteroparity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semelparity_and_iteroparity</a></li></ul><p>A species&#39; capacity to reproduce, or its &quot;raw&quot; growth rate (without limits, such as in an exponential growth model).</p><h3>Models and Regulation/Limiting</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/v/exponential-and-logistic-growth-in-populations">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/v/exponential-and-logistic-growth-in-populations</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/v/density-dependent-and-density-independent-population-regulation">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/v/density-dependent-and-density-independent-population-regulation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/a/exponential-logistic-growth">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/a/exponential-logistic-growth</a></li></ul><p>There are several ways to model population growth of a given species, including or excluding external factors (such as deaths, predators, disease, resources, food, &amp;c). Two basic ones are exponential growth and logistic growth.</p><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/69602c1370155fd480bb092161bb963905c5c212.png" alt="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/69602c1370155fd480bb092161bb963905c5c212.png"></img><p>There are factors that contribute to the &quot;regulation&quot; or &quot;limiting&quot; of a population. They can generally be distinguished by &quot;density-dependent&quot; (usually biotic factors) and &quot;density-independent&quot; (usually abiotic factors).</p><p>Examples of density-dependent factors are resources (food, water, light, shelter, ...); predation; disease/parasites; waste. Examples of density-independent factors are natural disasters (forest fires, floods, pollution, draughts, meteorite, ...).</p><p>Another way to think about it, is that density-dependent factors are &quot;triggered&quot; depending on population graph, while density-independent factors don&#39;t. There&#39;s a theoretical limit to how big a population can grow, called &quot;carrying capacity&quot;, and real-life populations may never cross it, may cross over it a little, or may even oscillate around it.</p><p>Competition between individuals of the same species is called &quot;intraspecific competition&quot;.</p><p>Exponential growth can be modeled by a function such as P_I(t) = I*r^t (with t time, I initial population, and r growth factor).<br></br>And logistic growth can be modeled by a function such as P_I(t) = r * ((K-I)/K) * I (with t time, I initial population, r growth factor, and K the carrying capacity).</p><h3>Predator-Prey cycle</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/v/predator-prey-cycle">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/v/predator-prey-cycle</a></li><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/a/mechanisms-of-population-regulation">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/a/mechanisms-of-population-regulation</a></li></ul><p>The size of a predator population and a prey population are usually connected: when one is large, the other is large, and vice-versa. When there&#39;s a lot of prey and few predators, it&#39;s easier for predators to hunt and feed themselves, so number of predators goes up. But with predator population size increasing, prey population size decreases because there are more predators feeding now. They follow almost like a sine/cosine wave function.</p><h3>Malthusian limit (Thomas Malthus)</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/v/thomas-malthus-and-population-growth">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/population-growth-and-regulation/v/thomas-malthus-and-population-growth</a></li></ul><p>1798, &quot;An essay on the principle of population&quot;</p><h2>Interspecies interactions</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/community-ecosystem-ecology/v/interactions-between-populations">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/community-ecosystem-ecology/v/interactions-between-populations</a></li></ul><h3>Competition</h3><p>This correspnds to a species&#39; access to resources. This type of interaction can be represented by the symbology -/-, meaning, the larger one population is, the more negatively the other population is affected, and vice-versa.</p><h3>Predation</h3><p>This is more broad than only e.g. a feline eating another animal -- e.g. a goat eating grass is also considered predation (herbivory). This type of interaction is represented by +/- (left is predator and right is prey): the larger the prey population, the more the predator population is benefitted; but the larger the predator population, the more negatively the prey population is affected.</p><h3>Symbiosis</h3><p>Usually a long-lasting interaction. This is a key distinguishing feature from predation: whereas in predation the predator typically kills the prey quickly, in parasitism the parasite doesn&#39;t, letting the host live longer and thus benefit from the host for longer as well.</p><ul><li>Parasitism: +/-</li><li>Mutualism: +/+</li><li>Commensalism: +/0 (one side is benefitted while the other isn&#39;t particularly affected, neither positive nor negatively)</li></ul><h3>Niche</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/community-ecosystem-ecology/a/niches-competition">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/community-ecosystem-ecology/a/niches-competition</a></li></ul><p>In short, a species&#39; niche determines how it&#39;ll interact with other species. If two species have overlapping niches they&#39;ll compete.</p><blockquote>A species&#39; niche is its ecological role or &quot;way of life,&quot; which is defined by the full set of conditions, resources, and interactions it needs (or can make use of). Each species fits into an ecological community in its own special way and has its own tolerable ranges for many environmental factors. For example, a fish species&#39; niche might be defined partly by ranges of salinity (saltiness), pH (acidity), and temperature it can tolerate, as well as the types of food it can eat.</blockquote><p>The &quot;competition exclusion principle&quot; says that two species can&#39;t have the exact same niche; if they did they would compete for the same resources.<br></br>&quot;Resource partitioning&quot; consists in species &quot;partitioning&quot; resources they&#39;re both interested in -- e.g. feeding at different times of day.</p><h3>Defense mechanisms</h3><ul><li>Mechanical: thorns, hard shells, &amp;c</li><li>Chemical: toxic/poisonous substance, bad tasting, &amp;c</li><li>Camouflage: shouldn&#39;t require introduction</li><li>Aposematic coloration: &quot;warning&quot; coloration -- when organisms use color to warn or keep predators away</li><li>Batesian mimicry: imitating another species&#39; aposematic coloration, even without having the other defenses</li><li>Müllerian mimicry: imitating another species&#39; aposematic coloration, but actually having the same or similar chemical defenses (this leads to all look-alike species to be protected in the future, therefore being all benefitted)</li></ul><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/e69bb6c3f37d48d71e9690962baca2f45f3e2659.png" alt="Mechanical/Chemical"></img><br></br><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/f1a8ae1c2fae0623e2275345d972968b1d8d2f89.png" alt="Camouflage"></img><br></br><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/984732bba41c39270326ad8e9a90ca1596d43cc4.png" alt="Aposematic coloration + chemical"></img><br></br><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/a5cc2e447ae06f39d8bc3ae3f5141db959049f2c.png" alt="Batesian mimicry + mechanical"></img><br></br><img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/ff2a15e5a1967dba4db4a4fe5ad84d8459bad10f.png" alt="Müllerian mimicry + chemical"></img><h2>Biodiversity</h2><p>A simple definition of &quot;biodiversity&quot; is the number of species in an ecosystem.</p><p>@see Biodiversity Ecosystem Function</p><h3>Why is biodiversity important?</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/community-structure-and-diversity/v/biodiversity-ecosystems-and-ecological-networks">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/community-structure-and-diversity/v/biodiversity-ecosystems-and-ecological-networks</a></li></ul><p>Basically, it improves the ecosystem&#39;s resilience. It seems to work very similarly to a distributed network: the more reliance is put on a single node, the more likely it is to stop functioning if that node fails.</p><p>Because different species have different niches (short way of saying different roles/functions), the ecosystem functions well. If one particular species ceases to exist, the ecosystem may continue to function well, as other species of a similar or overlapping niche may &quot;pick up&quot; its work. However, the ecosystem has become more fragile, as there are fewer species doing that work. Take a few more out and you start to see the system fail.</p><p>One particular example is in the distribution of energy. A whale, to become as large as it is, it must consume A LOT of energy. When it dies, it can be turned into energy again by other species -- A LOT of energy. If instead the whale is killed and fished out of water, all the energy that could&#39;ve fed many species simply doesn&#39;t exist anymore for them -- it may be the difference between life and death, or a stable and unstable system.</p><p>Another way to think of it is that the greater the biodiversity, the less important is any particular interspecies interaction.</p></body></html>
