There appears to be no single website or paper (I get a few results with a search), so for now that&#39;s that. When the recording is released I may take a look again, maybe he included an author or some other reference, I don&#39;t remember.</p><p>According to him there are 4 kinds of GCs:</p><ul><li>mark-compact</li><li>mark-sweep</li><li>extraction (evacuation? ??? can&#39;t read my own hand-writing lol)</li><li>mark-region</li></ul><p>Immix is of that last type.</p><p>Whippet is a &quot;stop the world&quot; GC, though threads independently maintain their own stack trash; and it&#39;s sort of lazy: when a new object is allocated, one dead object is freed. This implies that on each GC cycle there&#39;s no way to know how much of the used memory is live or trash.</p><p>He mentions &quot;ephemerons&quot;, which I&#39;m still not sure what they are. There&#39;s this post on his blog that looks relevant:</p><ul><li><a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/01/24/parallel-ephemeron-tracing">parallel ephemeron tracing</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="fosdem2023.html">fosdem2023.gmi</a></li><li><a href="20230204.html">20230204.gmi</a></li><li><a href="pl.scheme.html">pl.scheme.gmi</a></li></ul></body></html>
