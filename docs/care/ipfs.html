To learn more you should go to the official website or search around.</p><ul><li><a href="list.html">Care list</a></li><li><a href="https://ipfs.io">https://ipfs.io</a></li></ul><p>If you don&#39;t want to install an IPFS node on your own computer(s) (I would highly recommend it) the way to access the network with just an HTTP browser is to use a public gateway.</p><p>If you install the IPFS browser companion, accessing IPFS URIs is just a matter of copy-pasting ipfs://XYZ or ipns://XYZ into your browser&#39;s bar, the plugin does the rest. I would recommend it if you&#39;re going to use IPFS semi-regularly.</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion">https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion</a></li></ul><p>Otherwise, this is how you do it manually: from ipfs://XYZ you copy the XYZ and go to https://XYZ.ipfs.dweb.link. If the URI has a ?filename=smth.txt query string, you should append it to the URI too: https://XYZ.ipfs.dweb.link?filename=smth.txt.</p><p>Last note: dweb.link is only one of the several public HTTP gateways available (and I believe it&#39;s operated by Protocol Labs, the company behind IPFS). For others check this list:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker">https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker</a></li></ul></body></html>
