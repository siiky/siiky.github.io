If you have the same edition, cool, if not: the &quot;Introduction&quot; starts on p3, and &quot;Climate Change and COVID-19&quot; ends on p230. Hopefully that will help getting around. For figures and tables you can try the &quot;Notes&quot; where you can find the sources and corresponding page.</p><p>Because Gemtext is so limited, here are some notes to disambiguate formatting: titles of things will be surrounded by quotes &quot;Like This&quot;. ALL CAPS mean either italics or bold. Page numbers will be shown as p123, figures and tables as &quot;fig p123&quot; and &quot;tbl p123&quot; respectively, and sources as &quot;src&quot;. Tables will be formatted in code blocks, and will additionally have their page and source in the block&#39;s alt text. The page numbers of other things (quotes, figures, &amp;c) will always come afterwards, never before. Likewise, comments about quotes/figures/tables/&amp;c should in general come afterwards, not before.</p><h1>Overview</h1><p>Here are some of my thoughts on the book in general, or the things I got out of it. Maybe you won&#39;t agree with them, but that&#39;s life (insert Frank Sinatra reference here).</p><h2>Tone</h2><p>First off, this is kinda personal preference, what makes me tick or makes me cringe, but I didn&#39;t like the overall tone and his unquestionably stating that &quot;progress&quot; is good.</p><p>My impression, from reading this book alone, is that he REALLY believes that the increasing consumerism of resources -- be they electricity, water, minerals/metals, &amp;c -- is a good thing, especially by &quot;the poor&quot;, as he puts it.</p><p>The exact thing that got us into this, he thinks should be liberally given to and used by &quot;the poor&quot;. So that they can wreck their own countries/land/habitat? Is this rational?</p><p>The acknowledgments chapter even has a huge list of people that supposedly contributed to the inception of the book in some way or another, including several researchers, professors, and renowned authors in the matter. Is it just me thinking about this? Or am I missing something that everyone else knows about?</p><p>It&#39;s almost funny after he mentioned David Foster Wallace&#39;s &quot;This Is Water&quot; (more later).</p><p>This is related to some of the themes discussed in &quot;Sex at Dawn&quot; from my point of view.</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_at_Dawn">Christopher Ryan, Cacilda Jeth√°, &quot;Sex at Dawn&quot;</a></li></ul><h2>Pollution of &quot;greener&quot; alternatives</h2><p>Throughout the whole book he continuously advocates for green energies (like solar and wind) and alternatives (like electric vehicles) but fails to mention even once the pollution involved in their production, and the fact that the current products/methods are not recyclable (see &quot;The Dark Side of Green Energies&quot;). Other actually greener production methods may exists, even if not as efficient as the currently in use -- as an example, see &quot;How to Build a Low-tech Solar Panel?&quot;. But for some reason there&#39;s no interest in these other methods.</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Pitron">Guillaume Pitron, &quot;The Dark Side of Green Energies&quot;</a></li><li><a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2021/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-solar-panel.html">Low-Tech Magazine, &quot;How to Build a Low-tech Solar Panel?&quot; (solar powered site)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2021/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-solar-panel.html">Low-Tech Magazine, &quot;How to Build a Low-tech Solar Panel?&quot; (conventional always-on site)</a></li></ul><h2>Green premium</h2><p>Didn&#39;t know the &quot;green premium&quot; term -- the extra price paid for greener alternatives. (I was familiar with the concept of course, just not the term)</p><h2>Reflect cost in price</h2><p>I like the idea of raising/lowering the price of something based on its environmental impact, thus better reflecting the true cost of something, and simultaneously discouraging &quot;bad&quot; alternatives over &quot;good&quot; alternatives.</p><p>The difficulty would be convincing people that this is a good thing. During the transition, the average Joe probably won&#39;t be interested in the fact the new thing is better for the environment but rather that what they&#39;re using currently became more expensive. In my view, this is of course irrational -- negative effects on the environment negatively affect everyone in the long run. But it&#39;s not something easy to convince someone of, and I for sure commit the same mistake occasionally.</p><p>The &quot;true cost&quot; of something is what snan calls &quot;externalities&quot;.</p><ul><li><a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/idiomdrottning.org/externalities">Idiomdrottning, &quot;Externalities&quot;</a></li></ul><h2>Sources &amp; lack thereof</h2><p>Some of his statements are not backed by any sources, you&#39;re supposed (I guess?) to just believe in his authority on the matter and go with it. Examples:</p><ul><li>money spent/saved over some period of time when comparing alternatives -- e.g. planting mangrove trees rather than not saves the world $80B/year;</li><li>amount of energy provided per amount of energy consumed by produced chickens, pigs, and cows -- 1/2, 1/3, 1/6, respectively; don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s the meat alone, or if it includes eggs, milk, &amp;c;</li><li>the amount of CO2 absorbed by a tree during its lifetime -- &quot;a good rule of thumb is 4 tons over the course 40 years.&quot;</li></ul><p>At least graphs and the like usually have sources.</p><h1>Chapters</h1><p>Didn&#39;t take notes on some of the chapters, so obviously those aren&#39;t here. But just because it may be of interest, here&#39;s the whole index:</p><ul><li>Introduction: 51 Billion to Zero</li><li>1. Why Zero?</li><li>2. This Will Be Hard</li><li>3.

Why Zero?</h2><p>We went from almost 0 (in 1850) to almost 40 billion (in 2018) tons of CO2 (emitted per year, I suppose). (fig p24) The figure includes also the rise of the average temperature over the years.</p><h2>2. This Will Be Hard</h2><p>From David Foster Wallace&#39;s speech &quot;This Is Water&quot; (p37-38):</p><blockquote>There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, &quot;Morning, boys, how&#39;s the water?&quot; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, &quot;What the hell is water?&quot;</blockquote><p>David&#39;s explanation (p38):</p><blockquote>The immediate point of the fish story is that the most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that are the hardest to see and talk about.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water">David Foster Wallace, &quot;This Is Water&quot;</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a></li></ul><blockquote>Many farmers still have to use ancient techniques, which is one of the reasons they&#39;re trapped in poverty. They deserve modern equipment and approaches, but right now using those tools means producing more greenhouse gases.</blockquote><p>(fig p43) Why assume that WE are the superior ones and that THEY have to &quot;progress&quot;? Until 1850 (according to fig p24) we barely made a dent to the climate. How can you assume that &quot;progressing&quot; was a good thing? Even agriculture may have been a mistake (&quot;Sex at Dawn&quot;)!</p><h2>3. Five Questions to Ask in Every Climate Conversation</h2><pre>|-----------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------|

</pre><p>Human activities and their percentage of greenhouse gases emitted. He gives a definition of what goes where in a footnote:</p><blockquote>These percentages represent global greenhouse gas emissions. When you&#39;re categorizing emissions from various sources, one of the questions you have to decide is how to count products that cause emissions both when you make them and when you use them. For example, we produce greenhouse gases when we refine oil into gasoline and again when we burn the gasoline. In this book, I&#39;ve included all the emissions from making things in &quot;How we make things&quot; and all the emissions from using them in their respective categories. So oil refining goes under &quot;How we make things,&quot; and burning gasoline is included in &quot;How we get around.&quot; The same goes for things like cars, planes, and ships. The steel that they&#39;re made of is counted under &quot;How we make things,&quot; and the emissions from the fuels they burn go under &quot;How we get around.&quot;</blockquote><p>This (tbl p55) was possibly the most unexpected thing I learned from the book. I didn&#39;t expect at all for production of materials to be at the top and electricity next. Even more for food (mainly animals) being worse than transport. Just shows how well (un)informed I am (or was)...</p><pre>|------------------------+--------------|

For one thing, meat plays too important a role in human culture. In many parts of the world, even where it&#39;s scarce, eating meat is a crucial part of festivals and celebrations. In France, the gastronomic meal -- including started, meat or fish, cheese, and dessert -- is officially listed as part of the country&#39;s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
