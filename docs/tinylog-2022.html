Some guy apparently on coke hangover needing a fix.<br></br>She was alone, doing store stuff when the guy came in. Pretended he was looking at this and that, picked a couple of things and went to the counter. He showed the wooden cable of something out of his backpack (she&#39;s not sure what, maybe a hammer) and asked her for all of the cash from the counter. She confronted him saying she wouldn&#39;t give him any money, and that he wouldn&#39;t do anything to her or himself.<br></br>After asking why he was doing it, he said that he&#39;d never done anything like that before (i.e. robbing). He was almost shaking at this point, so nervous he was.<br></br>In the end, it worked out fine. He apologized a ton, said he was gonna drop whatever he had in the backpack at home, and that he wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone. He also left a note with his phone number thanking for the encouragement to get clean and asked her to check on him from time to time.<br></br>Although it went fine, I&#39;m not sure confronting him was the right choice to make. Obviously in retrospect it was, but I don&#39;t know if it was brave or just plain stupid.</p><h2>2022-09-24 12:23 +0100</h2><p>The other day I was reminded of toki pona when I found by chance @sloum&#39;s toki pona/English dictionary.<br></br>Yesterday I decided to finally jump in and read the first 4 lessons of the toki pona book.

If not free, at least holding something nice: a hot churro, a fresh bola de berlim, or someone else&#39;s hand. :)<br></br>It&#39;s almost an achievement to have survived without one, to be honest. Winter is all about rain, to the point where streets/roads have to be closed off because they get flooded.

In the past I would go with my DAP everywhere, always listening to music or podcasts. But nowadays when I&#39;m walking I try to really pay attention to what&#39;s around me: I look at surface details, birds flying around, trees swaying, larger insects crawling about, what people around me are doing, ...<br></br>Sometimes I do think about stuff instead, but that&#39;s the exception for sure, not the norm.</p><h2>2022-08-09 14:50 +0100</h2><p>I&#39;ve mentioned Tai Chi in the past, now I finally got to try it!

I already started working on converting my so very complexicated webshite into a lean and simple(r) Gemini capsule. Still have some quirks to think about (how to make it available in HTML form, because of links), but should be up soon enough!

Maybe you&#39;re OK with that, but if you eventually become unOK, there&#39;s nothing you can technically do to deny them future access. With a proper DRM system this should be possible. I was reminded of this by a couple of posts I read recently:</p><ul><li><a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/users/solderpunk/gemlog/low-budget-p2p-content-distribution-with-git.gmi">Solderpunk, &quot;Low budget P2P content distribution with git&quot;</a></li><li><a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/alexschroeder.ch/page/2018-06-29_No_Take_Back">Alex SchrÃ¶der, &quot;No take back&quot;</a></li></ul><h2>2022-06-29 10:50 +0100</h2><p>The other day I heard some pop song on the radio (note-se: because I was forced to). It was almost like any other shitty pop song that goes on the radio, but it had a flair to it you don&#39;t usually hear in pop; it had a weird sequence of notes, almost dissonant. Now, I would never in general be in favor of shit music. But if this one is popular enough to result in people listening to more weird (and thus better) music, that&#39;s a good thing! So this song is good (though still not a good song). I don&#39;t know the song&#39;s name, but I&#39;m almost 100% sure it was by Carolina Deslandes.</p><h2>2022-06-23 13:47 +0100</h2><p>I use card-like pieces (train/subway tickets) as markers for places I want to transcribe or take notes from physical books, but I never write right away what the marker is for, so I forget often when it&#39;s time to type into Org Roam.<br></br>Yesterday I thought a teeny tiny A7 notebook per book may be a good alternative, and ~1yr ago I learned how to manually bind books -- very simple method, single-signature only, not at all polished: a single A4 sheet of paper cut into 4 A6 sheets, and each A6 sheet folded in half: 16 A7 pages of readily available paper estate! Just made one in ~10min: 2 holes at about 3cm from the top and bottom margin, thread with a needle 3/4 times, knot.<br></br>Has the downside of needing a pencil/pen at all times, but it&#39;s so slim it can be used as a book marker too.</p><h2>2022-06-23 01:51 +0100</h2><p>Wrote a oneliner to get a (I think valid) Gemfeed out of all my input files, ordered by the date each was last edited according to git log, complete with title and all -- the first line of all my files is the title, be they Markdown, Org, or Gemtext, and luckily for me the line starts with some sort of tag, some space, and then the title.<br></br>Here it is:</p><pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash
