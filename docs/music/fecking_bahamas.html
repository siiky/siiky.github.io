Like the previous ones, it&#39;s pay-what-you-want with no lower limit.</p><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.com">Fecking Bahamas</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/album/viii-u-s-west-coast-pacific-northwest">VIII. U.S. West Coast // Pacific Northwest</a></li></ul><p>It&#39;s been a really long time since I last was this excited about an album! I&#39;m about halfway and it&#39;s pretty good. But there&#39;s this little something in Ireland and Australasia, even in France, missing here...</p><p>At first I was planning only a quick mention in the tinylog, but that doesn&#39;t make justice to how much I appreciate these compilations. So let&#39;s make a short summary of my favorite compilations and songs.</p><h2>IV. France</h2><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/album/iv-france">IV. France</a></li></ul><p>It&#39;s almost unfair to say this, but there&#39;s not one song from VIII that beats the opening for France, Chevalier Bulltoe by Totorro. That PHAT BASS! HM HM HM! Pneu makes an appearance in track 6, nice. Didn&#39;t know any of the other bands.</p><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/totorro-chevalier-bulltoe">1. Totorro - Chevalier Bulltoe</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/deer-belling-caf-abstract-dynamics">10. Deer Belling Café - Abstract Dynamics</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/pneu-municipal-geographic">6. Pneu - Municipal Geographic</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/papier-tigre-im-someone-who-dies">21. Papier Tigre - I&#39;m Someone Who Dies</a></li></ul><h2>III. Australasia</h2><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/album/iii-australasia">III. Australasia</a></li></ul><p>III is an obvious good contender, closing with Plini -- anything with Plini is a good contender out of the bat. But that opening by Sparkspitter? Perfect. Didn&#39;t know any of the bands other than Plini.</p><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/sparkspitter-sunrise-above-clouds-im-all-yours">1. Sparkspitter - Sunrise Above Clouds (I&#39;m All Yours)</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/skinny-jean-scales">19. Skinny Jean - Scales</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/plini-atlas">22. Plini - Atlas</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/seims-covet">2. SEIMS - COVET</a></li></ul><h2>VII. Portugal</h2><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/album/vii-portugal">VII. Portugal</a></li></ul><p>What was most impressive to me about the Portugal (VII) was that I didn&#39;t know most of the bands! It has the mandatory Memória de Peixe and PAUS, of course! Although there&#39;s no way to make the wrong choice when it comes to these two bands -- easily two of my favorite Portuguese bands -- that wasn&#39;t the best choice for PAUS in my opinion. Quelle Dead Gazelle also makes an unexpected, though pleasant, appearance. And those are the three bands that I knew.</p><p>Otherwise, not that great a contender, sadly; there were no REALLY memorable tracks... To make it clear, VII is not one of my favorites, I enjoyed Japan (I) and Russia (II) more, and even those are probably behind Argentina (VI)! (short way of saying that VII is probably my least favorite)</p><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/supercollider">1. Memória de Peixe - Supercollider</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/mi-ah-ha">2. Don Pie Pie - Mi-Ah-Ha</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/pelo-pulso">6. PAUS - Pelo Pulso</a></li><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/abismo">7. Quelle Dead Gazelle - Abismo</a></li></ul><h2>V. Ireland</h2><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/album/v-ireland">V. Ireland</a></li></ul><p>And so we reach my favorite: Ireland! I knew none of the bands before. The opening is not as punchy as Australasia or even Portugal, but still a plusgood track. And what I think differs from this compilation to the others is that it&#39;s so consistent. This compilation isn&#39;t my favorite because of two or three fucking awesome tracks; it&#39;s my favorite because all the tracks are fucking great! You don&#39;t feel like in a rollercoaster -- now we&#39;re at the top, next we&#39;re at the bottom. Instead, the tracks fluctuate in a children-safe rollercoaster up there around the clouds!</p><ul><li><a href="https://feckingbahamas.bandcamp.com/track/adebisi-shank-world-in-harmony">18.

I&#39;d love to see Turkey or Greece, or just about any country from Africa, Asia or the middle east.</p></body></html>
