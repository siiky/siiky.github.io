It was very nice getting a break from my routine and right before University starts again. But there was the whole time this thought on the back of my head... I&#39;m actively and negatively contributing to pollution and to maintaining consumerism. I tried not to think about it for this week and a half because I really needed this rest, but I don&#39;t want to pretend either.</p><p>My dad has a small patch of land where he can&#39;t (legally) really building anything that may (legally) be called a house. He&#39;s putting some shipping containers there for storage, but the remaining land is left unused. It&#39;s a nice bit of land because it&#39;s &quot;in the middle of nowhere&quot;, so I think it would be a good place to spend some alone &quot;vacations&quot; completely offline.</p><p>In truth, it&#39;s not completely in the middle of nowhere, there are a few houses nearby in a ~1km radius (just in case). Other than a silent retreat it would be good for me to start getting used to a &quot;slower&quot; and more &quot;boring&quot; life. I read some people around here on Gemini relating their &quot;less civilized&quot; lives (in a good way!), and I&#39;ve wanted to try it for a long, ever since I read Walden.</p><ul><li><a href="../books/list.html">Books list</a></li></ul></body></html>
