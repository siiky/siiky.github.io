By this definition it is simply impossible to be happy this &quot;civilized&quot; society. Everyday billions of people wake up, get up, and get ready for their new day of taking crap from others because &quot;that&#39;s life!&quot;</p><p>Tiny conveniences are trouted as great achievements and advances, possible only because of the ivilized society. Yet the huge inconveniences (to put it mildly) are overlooked. People think life&#39;s great because they have access to an overpriced and slowly rotting inside box they call a house; they think that indeed they&#39;re better off in life than those savages the indians, the aborigenes, the pagans, ... who live in tents. Surely, they ARE better off than those who don&#39;t know what is work, mortgages, loans, the colossal monetary gap between the majority and the barely out of the shit pit; they who don&#39;t know empathy and can&#39;t tell apart good from bad, they&#39;re better off than the ones who don&#39;t have to pay (save for respect) for water, piped or bottled up from distant lands, because they drink it from a clean nearby river or plants all year round.</p><p>They don&#39;t worry about food and &quot;better&quot; ways of &quot;producing&quot; it, because they don&#39;t overeat either.</p><p>The civilized sayd that working is worth the spare time they have later; and they praise the god science and technology for extending their miserable sick lives for another 30~40 years when, in truth, they don&#39;t realize it&#39;s been shortened for about 10, and forgot to do the rest of the math: 47*365*(5/7)*8/(24*364)=11.19 years.</p><p>Going easy on these numbers, leaning towards the civilized: one should take into account we sleep less; we worry more; we eat more (and A LOT of junk); we breathe dead dinosaurs (because it&#39;s better to move in massive metal boxes than to walk); we plaster our bodies with synthetic crap because that&#39;s gonna somehow improve our QoL; we don&#39;t have who to talk to because that would be showing weakness; we have our instincts repressed collectively because of a millenial work of fiction; ...</p><p>Golly am I glad to be alive in this great era!</p></body></html>
