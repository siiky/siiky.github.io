At least not with some friction.</p><p>In this post I&#39;d like to write about that, yet another aspect of life where flexibility can be useful (and possibly a hindrance!): human relations.</p><p>I first came across a similar idea (maybe when I first thought about this, in fact) reading one of Descartes&#39; books -- either &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; or &quot;Selections from the Principles of Philosophy&quot;, I can&#39;t remember. In that book he wrote that there were works he didn&#39;t want to publish during his lifetime.¹ &quot;Wut? why?&quot; He explains that his works were often controversial due to the nature of their content -- religion and God were particularly controversial² -- and by not publishing them he could continue with his life and work without any impediments (read: being imprisoned and/or killed).</p><p>If you tell a friend one day that you like a nice and hot churro (or fartura, the inferior alternative), you can&#39;t then tell them the next day that you don&#39;t like it, right? It doesn&#39;t make sense! It can look like you lied or are lying now.</p><p>Think of knowledge as a (consistent i.e. non-contradictory) set of propositions. From this point of view, acquiring knowledge is performing the set-union of the current propositions with the new. If a person knows that you like churros (P), and learns later that you /don&#39;t/ like churros (¬P), their knowledge becomes inconsistent: { P, ¬P } is inconsistent, because (P ∧ ¬P) is a contradiction!</p><p>Of course, people can change their opinions, tastes, and whatnot but it&#39;s a slow process, slow enough not to be flexible, the point of this post and the previous one.</p><p>&quot;So what&#39;s it mean?&quot; If you&#39;re of an opinion now that (you think) you&#39;re likely to change in the future, then... maybe you&#39;re better off not sharing it with others right now?</p><p>Because, if you change opinion in the future, it&#39;ll take time for people to adjust their knowledge set to your newly changed opinion; people will judge you hard if said opinion is controversial or doesn&#39;t go down their throats well; and, if you change opinion in the future, whatever negative side-effects came of your sharing it were most likely a net loss -- waste of time and energy, at best.</p><p>There&#39;s a caveat, though. I&#39;m here advocating that it may be a good idea to refrain from sharing details about yourself with other people, and I don&#39;t make any distinctions between close or not. But if you do it too much, especially with a close relation, the other person won&#39;t know that much about you, which may mean the relation isn&#39;t that great, and it may end because of it.</p><p>And a possible alternative to the all-or-nothing: very clearly stating that this opinion of yours is something prone to change, something you are thinking of/working on right now, but are not quite sure about just yet.</p><p>I think this might be kinda hard to pull off. People may think you&#39;re saying that just as an escape route in case shit hits the fan, for example. But I couldn&#39;t possibly guess all the weird ways people might think, the same way I couldn&#39;t possibly guess all the ways shit might hit the fan.</p><p>Just another tool in the toolbox... Maybe. Or not. ¯\__(ツ)_/¯</p><p>¹ There are cons to this, such as not discussing with as many people, but he was a pretty good thinker -- he had a strict method for reasoning, which was the subject of one of the two books (probably &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; judging by the title). On top of that (IIRC) he had a few close relations with whom to discuss the more controversial topics.</p><p>² Not that they somehow went against the state of affairs of the time. He believed in God, (one of them is supposed to be a proof it exists) and was religious (even supported the church IIRC).</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes">Descartes</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churro">Churro</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fartura_(food)">Fartura</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent">Consistent</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction">Contradiction</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition">Proposition</a></li><li><a href="../wiki/books.html">Books list</a></li></ul></body></html>
