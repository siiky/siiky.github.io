Flying over a cliff (rather than falling off it) when you obviously can&#39;t fly is not an alternative. But paying some extra at your local grocer rather than at the biggest supermarket chain probably is.</p><p>-----</p><p>These are some of my goals in line with this idea:</p><ul><li>[X] Stop using TIDAL</li><li>[X] Stop using Google Maps -- help get OSM good enough for everyday use</li><li>[x] Stop using FB messenger (and WhatsApp) once and for all -- already using Signal (other than IRC &amp; email) almost exclusively</li><li>[X] Move away from YT -- probably PeerTube or similar, or Invidious as last resort</li><li>[X] Move to SourceHut from GitHub -- just missing the time; hopefully this summer I&#39;ll have the time to move everything</li></ul></body></html>
