They can be used for cooking, eating, cutting paper, or pealing fruit. They can also be used for stabbing, cutting up, killing, and skinning people and animals. That doesn&#39;t make them undesirable or less appealing in any way. It&#39;s not why/how most would use them, and I wonder how we&#39;d go about our lives without knives!</p><p>A similar point could be made about other tools -- screwdrivers, hammers, crowbars, rope, syringes, ... I&#39;m not of a very creative mind but I could probably go on.</p><p>This post was triggered by a post by @hyperreal, who doesn&#39;t want to be associated with Web3/NFT/crypto crap. I can totally understand it as I try to steer away from such connections myself -- and sometimes I&#39;m repulsed away, e.g. when I find a possibly cool project but learn that it&#39;s written in fucking JS/TS/BullshitScript-of-the-day, or that it&#39;s &quot;AI/ML/blockchain-powered&quot;... give me a fucking break please!</p><ul><li><a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/hyperreal.coffee/gemlog/2022-09-17-considering-using-ipfs-for-content-hosting.gmi">Considering using IPFS for content hosting</a></li></ul><blockquote>I&#39;m just not sure about its adjacency to the NFT/Web3 scene.<br></br>(...)<br></br>Still, though, I don&#39;t like the idea of being complicit in the NFT/Web3 hype. Aside from the environmental hazards involved in minting NFTs and mining cryptocurrency, it&#39;s a Ponzi scheme that deceives people into investing monetary value into something that is inherently valueless and thrives off the delusion that they own the thing.</blockquote><p>By simply using IPFS you wouldn&#39;t be as complicit in anything to do with the NFT/Web3 bullshittery any more than you&#39;d be complicit in someone using a crowbar to bash another person&#39;s head in, or someone using a rope to hang themselves -- if you don&#39;t take part in any of the bullshittery then you&#39;re not complicit in said bullshittery!</p><p>My intention was not to pick or call out on you in the least so please don&#39;t take it personally!</p><p>DISCLAIMER: I like IPFS!</p><ul><li><a href="../alt.html">Alternative ways to access this capsule</a></li><li><a href="../projects/ipfs.html">ipfs.scm</a></li><li><a href="../projects/gemini-ipfs-gateway.html">Gemini IPFS gateway</a></li><li><a href="../care/list.html">Care list</a></li><li><a href="../kB45oC/mirrors.html">Content-based Mirrors</a></li></ul><p>Related:</p><ul><li><a href="re-tech-and-conscience.html">RE: Technology and Conscience</a></li></ul></body></html>
