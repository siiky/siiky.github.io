However, for some reason that I haven&#39;t figured out yet, it&#39;s hard to get going. Won&#39;t try to speak for anyone else, but as for me, there&#39;s always a what if, such as, what if I had donated to this instead of that? what if this turns out to be evil?</p><p>My mom, who earns in a month less than me by half, used to donate more than me. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m unique in that; I&#39;m sure there are many people out there that can donate (have the monetary power) but don&#39;t.</p><p>Think of everything that you use or have used for free, think only of things that are distributed freely by their creators and that you haven&#39;t paid for nor donated to; realize that it took effort to create it, and that otherwise, e.g. with a book or a movie, you&#39;d have to pay for it somewhere; given that you haven&#39;t paid for it, it should be obvious that you&#39;re committing &quot;theft&quot;. Theft is probably on everyone&#39;s naughty list; assuming that we are and/or want to be ethical, then it&#39;s something to avoid.</p><p>I understand that this is so oversimplified it almost couldn&#39;t be at all helpful. And I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve overlooked many aspects of the whole situation.</p><p>But this isn&#39;t supposed to be some very deep philosophical thinking. It&#39;s just a bit of rhetoric to try and convince people to donate to things they enjoy and would like to keep afloat.</p><p>Using rhetoric to improve people... I bet Plato didn&#39;t see that coming!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1672">Plato, &quot;Gorgias&quot;</a></li></ul></body></html>
