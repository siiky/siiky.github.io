How do I know I&#39;m truly me, and not just my brain in another body that looks like mine, or a clone of the original, real me? Is my brain what defines me? If my brain were to be cloned, would two of me exist, or would we be one and the same? Assuming one, would we still be the same after having different experiences? I would think not; one cannot, at the same time, have and not have an experience.</p><p>Imagine there&#39;s an object you treasure, that&#39;s special to you in some way, -- maybe it has sentimental value because it was given to you by someone special to you -- and imagine you&#39;re holding it in your hands right now. How do you know the object you&#39;re holding in your hands is the one special object you treasure so much?</p><p>For simplicity, let&#39;s imagine something really simple for our object, -- something with no moving parts, not too big, not too small, a single color, no smell, simple form, smooth surface, and any other properties I may be neglecting -- for example, a marble.</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_(toy)">Marble</a></li></ul><p>Let&#39;s imagine our marble is of the most common size, 1.3cm in diameter (according to Wikipedia), which makes it around 1.150cm$^3$ in volume; it&#39;s mostly unused, so it&#39;s as good as new, and the surface is really smooth; it&#39;s yellow in color (pretending iron is yellow), and it&#39;s opaque; it&#39;s completely made out of pure iron, so its mass is approximately 9.059g (iron&#39;s density is 7.874g/cm$^3$, according to Wikipedia).</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron">Iron</a></li></ul><p>And now, let&#39;s imagine we&#39;re given another marble exactly like the one we already have -- all properties are the same, as far as we can discern them. We put them in separate places to distinguish them -- the &quot;original&quot; on the right, and the other one on the left.</p><p>This marble is very special to us; we give it much value. Maybe it&#39;s our lucky charm, and we take it with us to special events, like tests. What would happen if someone were to swap both marbles without our knowledge? Since we can&#39;t distinguish them, we would inevitably think the wrong to be the right, and fall for the placebo effect of having our lucky charm with us, and therefore give value to something that should have none to us.</p><p>This must mean that the marble doesn&#39;t have any special value, or property, that separates it from all other marbles that are like the right one. We give it that value when we believe it&#39;s the right one.</p><p>Is position in the universe a part of an entity&#39;s properties? Clearly, an entity can&#39;t have two different positions simultaneously; moreover, two distinct entities can&#39;t have the same position simultaneously. So it&#39;s possible that the position could be used to uniquely identify an entity. However, an entity can change positions over time, therefore position cannot be a property inherent to the entity -- it would only be possible to identify an entity given both position and time. But even then, for this information to be useful to us, we&#39;d have to keep track of the position of our entities of interest over time. Like in the example above, we knew which of the marbles was the right one, up until the moment someone changed the universe without our knowledge, i.e., the universe and our knowledge of the universe are not in sync.</p></body></html>
