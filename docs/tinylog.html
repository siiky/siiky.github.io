The professors are hard to impress, but they didn&#39;t point out anything wrong with the project. They gave 2 or 3 ideas/suggestions/&quot;why didn&#39;t you do it this way?&quot;, that was all.

It had three big components: clients, session servers, and data servers. We wrote the clients in Erlang (our choice), the session servers in Erlang (requirement), and the data servers in Java (requirement). Clients and session servers communicated through TCP, and session servers and data servers communicated through ZeroMQ.<br></br>It had quite a few (proposed) features, we had to skip a couple for lack of time, and, personally, prefering to get shit just right instead of kinda working.<br></br>It was awesome working on a semi-serious project in Erlang and with ZeroMQ.</p><ul><li><a href="wiki/pl.erlang.html">wiki/pl.erlang.html</a></li></ul><h2>2023-06-13 15:58 +0100</h2><blockquote>O seguro morreu de velho; o desconfiado ainda é vivo.</blockquote><p>From EP08 of Ballet Rose.</p><ul><li><a href="wiki/cinema.ballet_rose.html">wiki/cinema.ballet_rose.html</a></li></ul><h2>2023-06-13 12:18 +0100</h2><p>I haven&#39;t finished a book in so long I forgot to update my books list the day before yesterday when I finished Allegro...</p><ul><li><a href="wiki/books.html">wiki/books.html</a></li><li><a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/fedran.com/allegro">https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/fedran.com/allegro</a></li></ul><p>I liked it and recommend it if fantasy is your thing.

Yesterday I watched S03E03 and there was this bit:</p><blockquote>Ragnar:<br></br>  Is she still alive?<br></br><br></br>Bjorn:<br></br>  Yes. But her face...<br></br><br></br>Ragnar:<br></br>  [funny face: stop being stupid and don&#39;t say that so close that she can hear you]<br></br><br></br>Bjorn:<br></br>  [sigh]<br></br>  It is my fault. I didn&#39;t protect her.<br></br><br></br>Ragnar:<br></br>  That is what her shield is for. We fight. That is how we win and that is how we die. Do you understand?<br></br><br></br>Bjorn:<br></br>  But she is with child!<br></br><br></br>Ragnar:<br></br>  [look and walk away in disbelief]<br></br>  And you let her come? Huh?<br></br>  [bitch slap Bjorn]<br></br>  She will probably die, with your child in her belly, and it will be your fault, because you have the strength of a man, but the will of a little girl. I can&#39;t believe you are my son.<br></br>  [push Bjorn&#39;s face away with one hand, almost shouting] I can&#39;t even look at you!<br></br><br></br>Rollo:<br></br>  I do not think she will die.<br></br>  She wants to live. She has a lot to live for. But if she hears you weeping and lamenting, she will choose to die. Be strong. Be a man. Coax her back from Valhalla. But make it worth her while, for she is already at the gates.</blockquote><p>They&#39;re talking about Porunn, who was slashed in the face with a sword.<br></br>I didn&#39;t really understand Ragnar&#39;s reaction. Some women fight alongside the men, it seems they are, at least somewhat, equals. So was his reaction due to her being a woman? I think not. I think it was because she&#39;s pregnant. But then what&#39;s with &quot;the strength of a man but will of a little girl&quot; and Rollo&#39;s manly talk?<br></br>Maybe only women who fight (so-called shield-maidens) go through fighting training, or endure more of it, and because others don&#39;t they&#39;re &quot;unequals&quot;.<br></br>Or maybe I&#39;m just overthinking it. Or maybe it&#39;s just good ol&#39; westernization!<br></br>Took another bit before this into the quotes yesterday.</p><ul><li><a href="words/quotes.html">just quotes</a></li></ul><h2>2023-01-30 13:55 +0000</h2><p>Today I&#39;m sick. Probably (hopefully) just a cold, though a bit aggressive.<br></br>Yesterday went to my grandmother&#39;s house and brought out an old slot car &amp; track set. The cars didn&#39;t work because of the track contacts. My cousin and me decided to try and bring them back to life. Unearthed some copperwire, hacked together new contacts (surprisingly more difficult than it seemed at first), and got the motors running again, just like that! Sadly, after a few laps the cars intermittently worked and didn&#39;t, because the teeth of the motor gears weren&#39;t in great shape (and our contact work wasn&#39;t the best either tbh).<br></br>In all, we spent much more time trying to get the things working than racing, but it was good fun.</p><h2>2023-01-29 01:41 +0000</h2><p>A friend the other day sent me this video about Roman concrete.
