It is a feature of creation science that we are regularly discovering interesting ways in which animals are designed to adapt to the varied environments in which they find themselves; this makes the study of animals not only interesting, but gives us many reasons to praise the Creator for his creative handiwork.</blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gem.librehacker.com/gemlog/your-word/20230423-0.gmi">Genesis 8:14-19: Stepping Out of the Ark</a></li></ul><p>Somehow, people believe fictional texts written a couple thousand years or more ago to be fact.<br></br>They think there&#39;s an omnipotent, omnipresent, omnithis and omnithat being, that created all other beings on this planet with an intent, a purpose for each of them. Being omniomni, this implies that all is also according to its will, never against.<br></br>Did this special being create us (human scum) so that we may abuse and kill other human scum then?

I finally installed LineageOS on a phone, and it seems to function well!<br></br>Just out of luck, I &quot;have&quot; 2 other phones of the same model as mine (Xiaomi Mi A2). One of those is my dad&#39;s previous phone that he doesn&#39;t use anymore. Perfect opportunity! Plus, my mom&#39;s phone is giving its last breaths...

The Android and other relevant repositories (for this phone model) use up ~174GB of disk; with all built artifacts and products it&#39;s using ~225GB now; built artifacts of this phone alone are ~26GB. The first build took more than 6h on my Ryzen 3 2200G. It&#39;s likely this time could&#39;ve been shortened by using an SSD, but meh and I don&#39;t a large enough SSD anyway. The first build failed 2 or 3 times due to RAM usage (I have 32GB, which is enough, but I also use vm.overcommit_memory=2, which more conservatively rejects memory allocations).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting">https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting</a></li></ul><p>That was last week.

At the time I was stuck with what seemed to be a bug in the addition of digits to a bignum AND/OR a bug in the conversion to/from strings in base 16.<br></br>But it turns out it was neither! Addition of digits to a number is working just fine; and so is conversion to/from strings!<br></br>The bug was instead in the example program itself, in the usage of sbn_add_digit_u() (the non-destructive (i.e., functional) counterpart of sbn_add_digit_ud()). The likely root problem is in sbn_clone().<br></br>For now I haven&#39;t advanced the library any further (just moved some configs around), but this is really good news for me and the library.</p><ul><li><a href="wiki/pl.c.html">C § c-utils</a></li><li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/c-utils/tree/sbn/item/include/utils/sbn.h">https://git.sr.ht/~siiky/c-utils/tree/sbn/item/include/utils/sbn.h</a></li></ul><h2>2023-03-02 11:33 +0000</h2><p>What does it mean to like someone or something?</p><h2>2023-02-25 15:01 +0000</h2><p>Yesterday night I learned of Disjoint Sets from a friend.

Apparently irssi doesn&#39;t have the necessary features to be able to fetch past history.<br></br>During FOSDEM 2023 I got to try Matrix a bit more (I already had an account) and, well, it&#39;s not all that bad. The &quot;default&quot; web client (Element) kinda sucks (because, web). But I got to try FluffyChat (desktop &amp; Android), Nheko, Syphon, and Element (on Android), and here&#39;s the verdict:</p><ul><li>Nheko is pretty nice (thanks to @c-keen:nerdberg.de from #chicken for the recommendation)</li><li>Element on Android is not nearly as sucky as Element on the browser</li><li>FluffyChat is decent on Android (liking it more than Element, though there&#39;s an annoying bug), but not so much on the desktop -- why won&#39;t it use as much screen space as possible?! why keep everything in such a narrow strip in the middle of the screen?!</li><li>Syphon looks really promising! But it&#39;s not ready for everyday use...</li></ul><p>So on the desktop I&#39;m probably settled on Nheko for now. On Android I&#39;m still given both FluffyChat and Element a try, but I&#39;m tending to FluffyChat.<br></br>In the future I&#39;m thinking of having a couple of separate accounts so FluffyChat is so far the winner there -- it&#39;s the only client of those I tried that has (beta) support for several accounts.

But her face...<br></br><br></br>Ragnar:<br></br>  [funny face: stop being stupid and don&#39;t say that so close that she can hear you]<br></br><br></br>Bjorn:<br></br>  [sigh]<br></br>  It is my fault. I didn&#39;t protect her.<br></br><br></br>Ragnar:<br></br>  That is what her shield is for. We fight. That is how we win and that is how we die.

Huh?<br></br>  [bitch slap Bjorn]<br></br>  She will probably die, with your child in her belly, and it will be your fault, because you have the strength of a man, but the will of a little girl.

She has a lot to live for. But if she hears you weeping and lamenting, she will choose to die. Be strong. Be a man. Coax her back from Valhalla.

Some women fight alongside the men, it seems they are, at least somewhat, equals. So was his reaction due to her being a woman? I think not. I think it was because she&#39;s pregnant. But then what&#39;s with &quot;the strength of a man but will of a little girl&quot; and Rollo&#39;s manly talk?<br></br>Maybe only women who fight (so-called shield-maidens) go through fighting training, or endure more of it, and because others don&#39;t they&#39;re &quot;unequals&quot;.<br></br>Or maybe I&#39;m just overthinking it.

The cars didn&#39;t work because of the track contacts. My cousin and me decided to try and bring them back to life. Unearthed some copperwire, hacked together new contacts (surprisingly more difficult than it seemed at first), and got the motors running again, just like that! Sadly, after a few laps the cars intermittently worked and didn&#39;t, because the teeth of the motor gears weren&#39;t in great shape (and our contact work wasn&#39;t the best either tbh).<br></br>In all, we spent much more time trying to get the things working than racing, but it was good fun.</p><h2>2023-01-29 01:41 +0000</h2><p>A friend the other day sent me this video about Roman concrete.
