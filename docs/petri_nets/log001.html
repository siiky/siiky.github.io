Plus, there&#39;s no current &quot;state&quot; (the mentioned places), very different from other more common automata theories! Not only that, but what they call a &quot;state&quot; is the number of tokens in each place -- what?</p><p>Once I saw Fig. 2.8 and 2.9, however, it clicked: a transition is enabled (can fire, &quot;execute&quot;) if its input tokens can be satisfied by all its input places. So what&#39;s currently a valid &quot;step&quot; in the system is determined by the number of tokens in each place, just like the &quot;current state&quot; of other automata determines the valid next transitions. And, several transitions may execute simultaneously (as long as their executions don&#39;t prevent each other)!</p><p>Yesterday and today were good days in this regard. I now understand how Petri nets can represent concurrent/parallel behavior, because transitions are like independent &quot;processes&quot; (a la Erlang); and that places are more like variables, or resources, possibly shared between many transitions (processes).</p><p>There&#39;s a site referenced right at the end of Ch. 2 where you can read the basics of the basics and play with some simple nets. Unfortunately you can only play with already defined ones, you can&#39;t define new ones or change those of the website.</p><ul><li><a href="https://petrinet.org">https://petrinet.org</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="logs.html">Logs index</a></li></ul></body></html>
