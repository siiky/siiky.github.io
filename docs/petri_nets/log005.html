But it was good to get a point of contact (now I have &quot;permission&quot; to ask them questions), and they gave us accounts to use the platform they&#39;re working on. It looks really neat, but I still haven&#39;t gotten around to try it out for real.</p><ul><li><a href="https://statebox.tv/act2022/tutorial">To get an idea check out Statebox TV</a></li></ul><p>If I understood correctly they still don&#39;t have an actual programming language for people to use. But several people can work on the same document simultaneously like in Overleaf, CoCalc, Google Colab, Google Docs, &amp;c.</p><ul><li><a href="logs.html">Logs index</a></li></ul></body></html>
