x_food = foo(x)
x_bard_food = bar(x_food)
x_zazd_bard_food = zaz(x_bard_food)
</pre><p>Good (using procedural composition):</p><pre>x = zaz(bar(foo(&#39;42&#39;)))
</pre><p>Better (if the chain of operations is long):</p><pre>x = &#39;42&#39;
x = foo(x)
x = bar(x)
x = zaz(x)
</pre><p>Best (using functional composition):</p><pre>(=&gt; &#39;42&#39;
    foo
    bar
    zaz)

; OR

((-&gt; foo bar zaz) &#39;42&#39;)
</pre><p>It also comes with rather nice advantages. Just compare the two approaches in each scenario:</p><ul><li>Imagine you want to change the order of operations in the chain;</li><li>Imagine you want to add an operation to the chain;</li><li>Imagine you want to remove an operation from the chain.</li></ul><p>And a final bonus: the &quot;better&quot; approach is easier to read than the &quot;bad&quot; approach, and requires less typing, thank you very much.</p></body></html>
