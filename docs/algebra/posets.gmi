Take a look at my other page on groups for the notation I'll be using here.

=> groups.gmi Groups

The transitive closure of a relation θ, often represented as θ^*, is defined as:

(a, b) ∈ θ^* ⇔ ∃ c ∈ S: (a, c) ∈ θ ∧ (c, b) ∈ θ^*

# Interesting relation properties

* Non-Reflexive: ∀ a ∈ S: (a, a) ∉ θ
* Anti-Symmetric: ∀ a, b ∈ S: (a, b) ∈ θ ⇒ (b, a) ∉ θ
* Anti-Transitive: ∀ a, b, c ∈ S: (a, b) ∈ θ ∧ (b, c) ∈ θ ⇒ (a, c) ∉ θ
