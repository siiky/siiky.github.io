After I explained in broad terms the whole flow, they asked &quot;what if ...?&quot;</p><p>Indeed there was a possible deadlock. But afterwards they started trying to prove to me that the deadlock wasn&#39;t possible because &quot;we can see beforehand if we need to lock here&quot;, and I had to tell them that &quot;no, that&#39;s not how that goes, because before we can check if we need to lock, we have first to update some internal state for which we need the lock&quot;. They even made some message sequence diagrams to explain the circumstances.</p><p>Basically, they were thinking of a previous version of the program. And I had to tell them that that&#39;s not how the new program went, at least 3 times.</p><p>So, abstraction is great, but read the code!</p></body></html>
