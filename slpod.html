<h1># SLPOD (Suckless Podcatcher)</h1>

`SLPOD` is a podcatcher design idea, supposed to be simple, fast and easy to use.

<h2>## Simple design:</h2>

 * "Database" file in plain-text so it can be easily read/written
 * Download to predefined local directory(ies)
 * Sync downloaded files to remote directory (e.g. DAP, phone, tablet)
 * Fields associated with each file to represent statuses, such as:
     * Downloaded
     * Played
     * Sync

<h2>## Simple usage:</h2>

 * Add download links to database
 * Download files to local directory(ies)
 * Sync local and remote directories
