<h1># To do or not to do... That is the Question
</h1>Recently I discovered something at work that could be big. To find it is or not
actually big, more work has to be done. This work would entail messing with a
big project in a weird, and kinda old, language that I barely know, and that, I
believe, wouldn't like.

This work has to be done. I had the possibility to do it myself, or to let
someone else do it.

Because of the reasons above I was inclined to let someone else do it, but
hadn't decided yet. As that someone else said, it would be a good opportunity to
learn, and get experience, and the only thing I could think meanwhile was
&quot;hurgh... so much work...&quot;.

As I was still unsure I asked a friend about it and eventually we got to:


<blockquote>Friend: If it's not part of the job, then don't do it.
Me: If I'd do it, it wouldn't be because of my job.
Friend: What for then?

</blockquote>Huh... good question...

And it got me thinking for the reasons to do it. So far: learning and
experience. Another one is curriculum -- not many people have this big thing.

And the reasons to do it? Work.

So fuck it, let's do it! I started the following week.

Something else I got thinking is: should it be me doing it? I believe the most
capable person should do it for the best outcome possible; and I want the best
outcome possible. I believe the first someone else I mentioned is both more
capable and more experienced than me in this matter. So should it be this
someone else instead of me? I think it doesn't matter. There two outcomes
possible: the thing being big or not. If I'm not capable enough, I might not be
able to find that it's a big thing. But the thing may be big nonetheless. If
this is the case, the someone else can still take it and try it.

In conclusion, who should do what is important, I believe, but in this case not
pertinent, hence me not taking it into account on the choice of doing it or
not.
