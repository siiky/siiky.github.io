<h1 class="title">To do or not to do… That is the Question</h1>

<p>Recently I discovered something at work that could be big. To find it is or not actually big, more work has to be done. This work would entail messing with a big project in a weird, and kinda old, language that I barely know, and that, I believe, wouldn’t like.</p>
<p>This work has to be done. I had the possibility to do it myself, or to let someone else do it.</p>
<p>Because of the reasons above I was inclined to let someone else do it, but hadn’t decided yet. As that someone else said, it would be a good opportunity to learn, and get experience, and the only thing I could think meanwhile was <q>hurgh… so much work…</q>.</p>
<p>As I was still unsure I asked a friend about it and eventually we got to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friend: If it’s not part of the job, then don’t do it. Me: If I’d do it, it wouldn’t be because of my job. Friend: What for then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh… good question…</p>
<p>And it got me thinking for the reasons to do it. So far: learning and experience. Another one is curriculum – not many people have this big thing.</p>
<p>And the reasons to do it? Work.</p>
<p>So fuck it, let’s do it! I started the following week.</p>
<p>Something else I got thinking is: should it be me doing it? I believe the most capable person should do it for the best outcome possible; and I want the best outcome possible. I believe the first someone else I mentioned is both more capable and more experienced than me in this matter. So should it be this someone else instead of me? I think it doesn’t matter. There two outcomes possible: the thing being big or not. If I’m not capable enough, I might not be able to find that it’s a big thing. But the thing may be big nonetheless. If this is the case, the someone else can still take it and try it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, who should do what is important, I believe, but in this case not pertinent, hence me not taking it into account on the choice of doing it or not.</p>
