<h1># Credit
</h1>There are some types of work or achievements at work that can be credited
directly to one person or small group of people. I don't mean fixing bugs or
developing some new fancy useless feature, bug, for examples, a new
revolutionary algorithm, protocol, or cryptographic system. This may or may not
be a part of their job. Sometimes a white paper about the novelty is written
and published; and sometimes it isn't. In either case, it is not uncommon for
the matter to break out on news and social media sites. The titles usually go
something like &quot;<em>_company_</em> does <em>_big thing_</em>&quot;. Is this right?

A few months ago news with a title similar to the above broke out, and the
company was the one I work for. It was really big news, and all thanks to the
work of a group of two or three people in the company. Not anyone else. What
name is mentioned in the title? The <em>_company_</em>'s. Who did the work? The nameless
group inside the company.

One day, at lunch, the topic came up because of something the leader of that
small group said in an interview, when asked &quot;What are your comments, <em>_company_</em>
having done <em>_big thing_</em>?&quot;: &quot;Has it?&quot;. This coming up, almost at once, everyone
got up (not literally), as if someone had insulted <em>_favorite god_</em> inside
<em>_designated place of worship_</em>. And I just really don't get it. Why would anyone
think it's right to credit the <em>_company_</em> instead of the people who've actually
done something? How can a <em>_company_</em>, not being a being, not possessing of
reason, not being able to take an action, not being able to affect the real
physical world, possibly accomplish anything?

Maybe I'm being a bit harsh on the companies, but I believe crediting something
or someone for something it or they haven't done is not right. I would say the
<em>_&quot;companies&quot;_</em> could get credit for doing <strong>**The Right Thing (TM)**</strong> and investing
on someone competent and deserving of remuneration.

All companies mentioned in this post are fictious, not real, and any
resemblance to any other also not real companies is purely coincidental.
