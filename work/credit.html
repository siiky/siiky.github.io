<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This post has nothing to do with me or <a href="CVE-2020-26935.html">CVE-2020-26935</a>.</p>
<p>There are some types of work or achievements at work that can be credited directly to one person or small group of people. I don’t mean fixing bugs or developing some new fancy useless feature, but, for example, a new revolutionary algorithm, protocol, or cryptographic system. This may or may not be a part of their job. Sometimes a white paper about the novelty is written and published; and sometimes it isn’t. In either case, it is not uncommon for the matter to break out on news and social media sites. The titles usually go something like <q><em>&lt;company&gt;</em> does <em>&lt;big thing&gt;</em></q>. Is this right?</p>
<p>A few months ago news with a title somewhat similar to the above broke out, and the company was the one I work for. It was really big news, and all thanks to the work of a group of two or three people in the company. Not anyone else. What name is mentioned in the title? The <em>company</em>’s. Who did the work? The nameless group inside the company.</p>
<p>One day, at lunch, the topic came up because of something the leader of that small group said in an interview, when asked <q>What are your comments about <em>&lt;company&gt;</em> having done <em>&lt;big thing&gt;</em>?</q>: <q>Has it?</q>. This coming up, almost at once, everyone got up (figuratively), as if someone had insulted <em>&lt;personal deity&gt;</em> inside <em>&lt;designated place of worship of said deity&gt;</em>. And I just really don’t get it. Why would anyone think it’s right to credit the <em>company</em> instead of the people who’ve actually done something? How can a <em>company</em>, not being a being, not possessing of reason, not being able to take an action, not being able to affect the real physical world, possibly accomplish anything?</p>
<p>Maybe I’m being a bit harsh on companies, but I believe crediting something or someone for something it or they haven’t done is not right. I would say, if anything, the only credit <em><q>companies</q></em> deserve is for doing <em><strong>The Right Thing (TM)</strong></em> and investing on someone competent and deserving of remuneration.</p>
<p>/rant</p>
<p>All companies not mentioned in this post are fictious, not real, and any resemblance to any other also not real companies is purely coincidental.</p>
