<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This post has nothing to do with me or <a href="CVE-2020-26935.html">CVE-2020-26935</a>.</p>
<p>There are some types of work or achievements at work that can be credited directly to one person or small group of people. I don’t mean fixing bugs or developing some new fancy useless feature, but, for example, a new revolutionary algorithm, protocol, or cryptographic system. This may or may not be a part of their job. Sometimes a white paper about the novelty is written and published; and sometimes it isn’t. In either case, it is not uncommon for the matter to break out on news and social media sites. The titles usually go something like <q>$COMPANY does $BIGTHING</q>. Is this right?</p>
<p>A few months ago news with a title somewhat similar to the above broke out, and the company was the one I work for. It was really big news, and all thanks to the work of a group of two or three people in the company. Not anyone else. What name is mentioned in the title? The <em>company</em>’s. Who did the work? The nameless group inside the company.</p>
<p>One day, at lunch, the topic came up because of something the head of that small group said in an interview, when asked <q>What are your comments about $COMPANY having done $BIGTHING?</q>: <q>Has it?</q>. This coming up, almost at once, everyone got (figuratively) up, as if someone had insulted $PERSONALDEITY inside $DESIGNATEDPLACEOFWORSHIPOFSAIDDEITY. And I just really don’t get it. Why would anyone think it’s right to credit the <em>company</em> instead of the people who’ve actually done the thing? How can a <em>company</em>, not being a being, not in the possession of reason, not being able to take an action, not being able to affect the real physical world, possibly accomplish any a thing?</p>
<p>Maybe I’m being a bit harsh on companies, but I believe crediting something or someone for something it or they haven’t done is not right. I would say, if anything, the only credit companies deserve is for doing <em><strong>The Right Thing (TM)</strong></em> in investing on someone competent and deserving of remuneration.</p>

<p>All companies not mentioned in this post are fictious, not real, and any resemblance to any other also not real companies is purely coincidental.</p>
