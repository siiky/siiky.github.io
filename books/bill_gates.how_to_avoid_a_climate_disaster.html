<p class="author">siiky</p>
<p class="date">2022/04/09</p>
</header>
<p>Finished reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Avoid_a_Climate_Disaster">this book</a> recently (ISBN 978-0-241-44830-4) and in this post I want to share my opinions/critique, and try to compile all the notes I took while and after reading.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll put down page numbers in this post. If you have the same edition, cool, if not: the <em>Introduction</em> starts on p3, and <em>Climate Change and COVID-19</em> ends on p230. Hopefully that will help getting around. For figures and tables you can try the <em>Notes</em> where you can find the sources and corresponding page.</p>
<h1 data-number="1" id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts on the book in general, or the things I got out of it. Maybe you won&#39;t agree with them, but <em>that&#39;s life</em> (insert Frank Sinatra reference here).</p>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="tone"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Tone</h2>
<p>First off, this is kinda personal preference, what makes me tick or makes me cringe, but I didn&#39;t like the overall tone and his unquestionably stating that &quot;progress&quot; is good.</p>
<p>My impression, from reading this book alone, is that he <strong>really</strong> believes that the incresing consumerism of resources – be they electricity, water, minerals/metals, &amp;c – is a good thing, especially by &quot;the poor&quot;, as he puts it.</p>
<p>The exact thing that got us into this, he thinks should be liberally given to and used by &quot;the poor&quot;. So that they can wreck their own countries/land/habitat? Is this rational?</p>
<p>The ackownledgements chapter even has a <strong>huge</strong> list of people that supposedly contributed to the inception of the book in some way or another, including several researchers, professors, and renowned authors in the matter. Is it just me thinking about this? Or am I missing something that everyone else knows about?</p>
<p>It&#39;s almost funny after he mentioned David Foster Wallace&#39;s <em>This Is Water</em> (more later).</p>
<p>This point is related to some of the themes discussed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_at_Dawn"><em>Sex at Dawn</em></a> from my point of view.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="pollution-of-greener-alternatives"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Pollution of &quot;greener&quot; alternatives</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole book he continuously advocates for green energies (like solar and wind) and alternatives (like electric vehicles) but fails to mention even once the polution involved in their production, and the fact that the current products/methods are not recyclable (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Pitron"><em>The Dark Side of Green Energies</em></a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="green-premium"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Green premium</h2>
<p>Didn&#39;t know the <em>green premium</em> term – the extra price paid for greener alternatives. (I was familiar with the concept of course, just not the term)</p>
<h2 data-number="1.4" id="reflect-cost-in-price"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Reflect cost in price</h2>
<p>I like the idea of raising/lowering the price of something based on its environmental impact, thus better reflecting the true cost of something, and simultaneously discouraging &quot;bad&quot; alternatives over &quot;good&quot; alternatives.</p>
<p>The difficulty would be convincing people that this is a good thing. During the transition, the average Joe probably won&#39;t be interested in the fact the new thing is better for the environment but rather that what they&#39;re using currently became more expensive. In my view, this is of course irrational – negative effects on the environment negatively affect everyone in the long run. But it&#39;s not something easy to convince someone of, and I for sure commit the same mistake occasionally.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.5" id="sources"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Sources</h2>
<p>Some of his statements are not backed by any sources, you&#39;re supposed (I guess?) to just believe in his authority on the matter and go with it. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>money spent/saved over some period of time when comparing alternatives – e.g. planting mangrove trees rather than not saves the world $80B/year;</li>
<li>the amount of energy provided per amount of energy consumed by produced chickens, pigs, and cows (1/2, 1/3, 1/6, respectively, according to him); don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the meat alone, or if it includes eggs and milk;</li>
<li>the amount of CO2 absorbed by a tree during its lifetime – &quot;a good rule of thumb is 4 tons over the course 40 years.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>At least graphs and the like usually have sources.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="chapters"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Chapters</h1>
<p>Didn&#39;t take notes on some of the chapters, so obviously those aren&#39;t here. But just because it may be of interest, here&#39;s the index with shitty formatting:</p>

<h2 data-number="2.1" id="why-zero"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> <em>Why Zero?</em></h2>
<p>We went from almost 0 (in 1850) to almost 40 billion (in 2018) tons of CO2 (emitted per year, I suppose). (fig p24) The figure includes also the rise of the average temperature over the years.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="this-will-be-hard"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> <em>This Will Be Hard</em></h2>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a>&#39;s speech <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water"><em>This Is Water</em></a> (p37-38):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, &quot;Morning, boys, how&#39;s the water?&quot; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, &quot;What the hell is water?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David&#39;s explanation (p38):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The immediate point of the fish story is that the most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that are the hardest to see and talk about.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Many farmers still have to use ancient techniques, which is one of the reasons they&#39;re trapped in poverty. They deserve modern equipment and approaches, but right now using those tools means producing more greenhouse gases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(fig p43) Why assume that <em>we</em> are the superior ones and that <em>they</em> have to &quot;progress&quot;? Until 1850 (according to fig p24) we barely made a dent to the climate. How can you assume that &quot;progressing&quot; was a good thing? Even agriculture may have been a mistake (<em>Sex at Dawn</em>, again)!</p>

<p>Human activities and their percentage of greenhouse gases emitted (tbl p55; src: none). He gives a definition of what goes where in a footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These percentages represent global greenhouse gas emissions. When you&#39;re categorizing emissions from various sources, one of the questions you have to decide is how to count products that cause emissions both when you make them and when you use them. For example, we produce greenhouse gases when we refine oil into gasoline and again when we burn the gasoline. In this book, I&#39;ve included all the emissions from making things in &quot;How we make things&quot; and all the emissions from using them in their respective categories. So oil refining goes under &quot;How we make things,&quot; and burning gasoline is included in &quot;How we get around.&quot; The same goes for things like cars, planes, and ships. The steel that they&#39;re made of is counted under &quot;How we make things,&quot; and the emissions from the fuels they burn go under &quot;How we get around.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This (tbl p55) was possibly the most unexpected thing I learned from the book. I didn&#39;t expect at all for production of materials to be at the top and electricity next. Even more for food (mainly animals) being worse than transport. Just shows how well (un)informed I am (or was)…</p>

<p>Imagine if everyone had gotten together one day and said, &quot;Hey, cars are killing people. They&#39;re dangerous. Let&#39;s stop driving and give up these automobiles.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analogy with cars about how we stopped using and researching nuclear energy because of the past accidents. (p86)</p>
<p>It goes both ways too. We stopped using nuclear because of the accidents, but even though the other energy sources result in more deaths per unit of energy (tbl p85), we prefer using those.</p>
<p>Mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapower">TerraPower</a> (p86). Some marketing words (mainly for me to read about later): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_wave_reactor">&quot;traveling wave reactor&quot;</a>, capable of running off of the waste of other reactors (that is, used up Uranium, Plutonium, &amp;c). (p87)</p>

<p>DAC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture">Direct Air Capture</a>) – taking CO2 right off the air. (p95) The alternative, which seems to be more practicable nowadays, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage">point carbon capture</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to scoff at the idea that using power more efficiently would make a dent in climate change. My rationale: If you have limited resources to reduce emitions (and we do), then you&#39;d get the biggest impact by moving to zero emissions rather than by spending a lot trying to reduce the demand for energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A comment about using less energy. (p95) Is it dumb or what? The following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything that reduces the scale we need to reach is helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(p96) Whouldathunkit! Finally he says something more sensible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also a related approach called load shifting or demand shifting, which involves using power more consistently throughout the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(p96) This sounds like a <em>very</em> good idea, for the reason he states afterwards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now, we tend to generate power when we use it – for example, cranking up electric plants to run a city&#39;s light at night. With load shifting, though, we do the opposite: we use more electricity when it&#39;s cheapest to generate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(p96) And he goes on giving some examples of changes of thinking and habits.</p>
<p>This relates to a habit that I have to break… I tend to stay up late and wake up late.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.5" id="how-we-grow-things"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> <em>How We Grow Things</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug">Normam Borlaug</a> – discoverer/inventor of &quot;super crops&quot;. (p115)</p>
<p>A grown chicken gives 1 calorie for every 2 calories that it consumes; a pig 1 for every 3 calories; cows 1 for every 6. That is, we get only 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6, respectively, of the energy &quot;we put in&quot;. (p115; src: none)</p>
<p>Graph of the trend of meat consumption on some countries over the years, from 2000 to 2020, with predictions until 2028. (fig p116; src: <em>OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2020</em>) In 2020, million tons of meat consumed (approximate numbers, measured with a ruler): Mexico, 9.6; Brazil, 19.2; EU, 40; USA, 42; China, 80.</p>
<hr />
<p>After exposing how &quot;growing&quot; animals (significantly) contributes to global warming and how greenhouse gases come to be from this practice, and of ways to work around that or improve the situation (such as bioengineering animals to not produce greenhouse gases), this comes along:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hard-core vegan might propose another solution: <em>Instead of trying all these ways of reducing emissions, we should just stop raising livestock.</em> I can see the appeal of that argument, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s realistic. For one thing, meat plays too important a role in human culture. In many parts of the world, even where it&#39;s scarce, eating meat is a crucial part of festivals and celebrations. In France, the gastronomic meal – including started, meat or fish, cheese, and dessert – is officially listed as part of the country&#39;s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. According to the listing on the UNESCO website, &quot;The gastronomic meal emphasizes togetherness, the pleasure of taste, and the balance between human beings and the products of nature&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gates on &quot;hard-core veganism&quot;. (p118-119)</p>
<p><em><strong>What the fuck?</strong></em></p>
<p>1st WTF: &quot;hard-core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism">vegan</a>&quot;? I&#39;m pretty sure a vegan doesn&#39;t have to be hardcore to be of that opinion.</p>
<p>2nd WTF: &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage">Cultural Heritage</a>&quot;? My brain goes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_says_no"><em>computer says no</em></a> with this… The culture we&#39;re leaving behind (possibly literally) is to destroy what made it possible for culture to exist in the first place?</p>
<p>3rd WTF: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unesco">UNESCO</a>? Aren&#39;t these the guys behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals">SDGs</a> (&quot;Sustainable Development Goals&quot; – quotes super apropes)?</p>
<p>The same guys that put &quot;Climate action&quot;, &quot;Life below water&quot;, and &quot;Life on land&quot; as <em>almost</em> the least important goals (13, 14, and 15, respectively, out of 17 – <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Sustainable_Development_Goals.svg">pic</a>)? So much for sustainable…</p>
<p>The same guys that put water (6) as less important than poverty (1), food (2), health &amp; well being (3), quality education (4), and gender equality (5)? Yes, everybody knows you all your thirsts with knowledge quench!</p>
<p>And what the hell are &quot;No poverty&quot; (1), &quot;Responsible consumption and production&quot; (12) and &quot;Partnerships for the goals&quot; (17), anyway? Couldn&#39;t they have been any vaguer?</p>
<p>(To be fair, I haven&#39;t read each of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sustainable_Development_Goal_targets_and_indicators">goals&#39; descriptions</a>).</p>
<p>4th WTF: &quot;togetherness&quot;? You have to eat an animal (or animal product) to feel close to other people, like your friends and family? Reminds me of <a href="https://www.flashforwardpod.com/2016/08/10/episode-19-wheres-the-beef">this episode of FlashForward</a> where a listener/commenter(?) said &quot;a sunday isn&#39;t a sunday without my chicken wings&quot; or something of the sort. Ok, then… Maybe I&#39;m really so very abnormally undemanding, but I&#39;m good with a (literal) walk in the park.</p>
<p>5th WTF: &quot;pleasure of taste&quot;? Hmmm… Let&#39;s see. How do you season your meat or fish? Salt (lit. some rock out of sea water)? Spices (plants, seeds, roots, …)? Butter (very likely margerine – plant)? Some garlic (plant) and/or onion (plant)? Maybe some alcoholic beverage (wine – grapes; beer – cereals; vodka – cereals/potatoes; rum – sugarcanes)? Why use so many non-animal products if the said &quot;pleasure of taste&quot; is due to the meat? Admittedly, nowhere does it say that the &quot;pleasure of taste&quot; is due to the meat; but why would it be mentioned otherwise?</p>
<p>6th WTF: &quot;balance between human beings and the products of nature&quot;? Must have been a typo for sure: &quot;inbalance&quot;. And yes, good thing we, the good, well intentioned humans, are here to consume all the products of nature, otherwise they would all go to waste! And y&#39;all know that waste is a sin! Oh wait…</p>
<p>This must have been the most stupidestest retardadest paragraph of the entire book… He does say he enjoys a good burger, but it would be only an assumption, of course, to think that this is his opinion or if he&#39;s just sharing something he&#39;s heard. Plus, he also says he has invested in two companies working on &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_substitutes">plant-based</a> meat&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_meat"><em>Beyond Meat</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Foods"><em>Impossible Foods</em></a>. (I think calling it &quot;plant-based meat&quot; is stupid – if it&#39;s plant-based then it&#39;s not meat! But whatever, after that paragraph…)</p>
<p>And yes, some of my comments above may be a bit exaggedated, but… <em><strong>what the fuck?</strong></em></p>

This will offset at least some of the good you do by planting your trees.</p>

<p>Mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning">ACs</a> a few times and how they&#39;re oh so cool, but darn it they pollute…</p>
<p>Would have been a better use of paper talking about some alternatives not based on electricity. For heating, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_mass_heater">rocket mass heater</a> (some people also call it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_stove">rocket stove</a>, even though they seem to be different things) sounds like a very good idea. The Wikipedia page about ACs also presents some alternatives.</p>

<p>All told, mangroves help the world avoid some $80 billion a year in losses from floods, and they save billions more in other ways. Planting mangroves is much cheaper than building breakwaters, and the trees also improve the water quality.</p>

<p>It&#39;s likely that there are sources out there to learn about the problem better than this book, but I learned some things from it. So to me it was worth reading, even though there were a few negative points and where I</p>

<p>The tone of the book really did turn me off a bit… But that&#39;s probably just me. Other than that, a really big omission is that of the pollution of &quot;greener&quot; alternatives. However, to give him some credit, he seems to really be invested in the problem and to be investing some phat $$$ into it.</p>
<p>Whether it&#39;s worth reading for you depends on you, however. If you&#39;re well into the topic, you probably learned nothing from this post, and in that case maybe you won&#39;t learn nothing from the book that&#39;s significantly worth it either. On the other hand, if you&#39;re leaving this post more informed than you were before, you may want to give the book a try.</p>
<p>If you have a different view on points I&#39;ve raised, contact me, I&#39;m interested in what other people have to say about the topic. If you know your stuff and have reading suggestions, <strong>do contact me!</strong></p>
