This is just a short pointer on how to use IPFS to access the [[../care/list.html][care list]], for
anyone who doesn't know and/or isn't interested in learning more about IPFS
/right now/. To learn more about IPFS you should go to https://ipfs.io or search
around.

If you don't want to install an IPFS node on your own computer(s) (I would
highly recommend it) the way to access the network with just an HTTP browser is
to use a public gateway.

When you see a URI like =ipfs://XYZ=, you should copy the =XYZ= and go to the
URL https://XYZ.ipfs.dweb.link. If the URI has a =?filename=smth.txt= query
string, you should append it to the URL too:
https://XYZ.ipfs.dweb.link?filename=smth.txt.
