IPFS root directory of this list: ipfs://bafybeigsdx4kf6v6tcda6s7cj53qzqhbf4xg2jzri6sz5b2smgbzyxpw5y

Because _sharing is caring_. This is a list of things I'm caring with others.
Some of the type of cares you may find here are books from [Gutenberg] or
[Standard Ebooks] that I particularly like; public movies/documentaries I find
interesting, important, and/or important (such as _Steal this Film_); and
copies of technical material distributed publicly and freely by their creators
(such as OPLSS lectures). Whatever care you may find here, it shouldn't be
illegal.

You'll find at least three spider cares.

The URL of the root of the list will be always at the top of the page (the
"IPFS root directory ..."). From it you can get to all other cares (if I don't
screw up). Over the rest of the page I'll post some notable cares and/or
(maybe) more details, maybe even sources.

The cares are added to IPFS using `ipfs add` with the options `--recursive
--raw-leaves --cid-version=1`. Additionally, videos should also get a
`--trickle `.

If you feel the urge to support someone after finding or benefitting from this
list, support the creators of the cares themselves.

# OPLSS (Oregon Programming Language Summer School)

Some of the lectures are mirrored on the path `/videos/oplss/`, or here: ipfs://bafybeidlgjvd6qdjgdb2vqtdnssvvfbv47m3wj2uyzknswhj5twktr37ne

**NOTE THAT I _may_ forget to update this URL, but the root will always be up
to date!**
