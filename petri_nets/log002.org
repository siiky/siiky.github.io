Finished reading Ch. 3 & 4 some weeks ago.

On Ch. 3 there wasn't that much new to me -- notation was slightly different
from what I was used to, but in general it wasn't complicated to follow. There
was terminology I didn't remember too, but mostly just had to go back and read
my notes from University.

Ch. 4, however, was an interesting one. They define two categories: one of Petri
nets (called =Petri=), with nets as objects; and another of Petri net executions
for a given net (called =F(N)=, with some Petri net =N=, and a fancy
calligraphic =F=), with markings as objects.

A morphism =N -> M= of =Petri= is a pair =〈f, g〉= where:

+ =f= is a function between the transitions of =N= and those of =M= (=T_N -> T_M=)
+ =g= is a multiset homomorphism between the markings(?) of both nets

Additionally, these morphisms must preserve a couple of properties:

+ =°(-)_M . f = g . °(-)_N=
+ =(-)°_M . f = g . (-)°_N=

The category =Petri= is actually restricted to a subcategory (=Petri_G=), which
is the one used in practice, but I think the details aren't relevant for this
post.
